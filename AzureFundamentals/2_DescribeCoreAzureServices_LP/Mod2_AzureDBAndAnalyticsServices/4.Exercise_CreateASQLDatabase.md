It can take approximately two to five minutes to create the server and deploy the sample database.
9. Select Go to resource.
10. Select Set server firewall, and then select Yes to Allow Azure services and resources to access this server.
11. Select Save.
12. Select OK.



Task 2: Test the database
In this task, you configure the server and run a SQL query.

1. From the All resources pane, search and select SQL databases and ensure that your new database was created. You might need to refresh the page.

2. Select the db1 entry representing the SQL database you created, and then select Query editor (preview) in the nav bar.
3. Sign in as sqluser, with the password Pa$$w0rd1234.
4. You will not be able to sign in. Read the error closely and make note of the IP address that needs to be allowed through the firewall.

7. Return to your SQL database and the Query Editor sign-in page. Try to sign in again as sqluser, with the password Pa$$w0rd1234. This time you should succeed. It might take a couple of minutes for the new firewall rule to be deployed. If you wait and still get an error, try selecting Firewall settings > again.
8. After you sign in successfully, the query pane appears. Enter the following query into the editor pane.
SQL

    Copy
    SELECT TOP 20 pc.Name as CategoryName, p.name as ProductName
    FROM SalesLT.ProductCategory pc
    JOIN SalesLT.Product p
    ON pc.productcategoryid = p.productcategoryid;
