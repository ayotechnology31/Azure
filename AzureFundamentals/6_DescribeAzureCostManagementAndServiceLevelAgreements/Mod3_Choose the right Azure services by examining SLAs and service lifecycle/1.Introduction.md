Tailwind Traders specializes in competitive pricing, fast shipping, and a large range of items. It's looking at cloud technologies to improve business operations and support growth into new markets. By moving to the cloud, the company plans to enhance its shopping experience to further differentiate itself from competitors.

**How will moving to the cloud affect availability agreements?**

Moving to the cloud removes the burden of supporting IT infrastructure. When network connectivity is lost or a hard drive fails, you rely on the cloud provider to restore service.

Tailwind Traders' IT department hosts applications and services in its datacenter for the rest of the company. The IT department has agreements with other teams in place that state how available those services will be, which includes when and how planned maintenance can happen. As Tailwind Traders moves its workloads to Azure, it no longer has full control over the hardware and networks. How will its agreements around availability be affected?
