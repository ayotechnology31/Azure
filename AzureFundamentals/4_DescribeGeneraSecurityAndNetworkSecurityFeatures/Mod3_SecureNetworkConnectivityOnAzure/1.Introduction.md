Introduction

1 minute

Every application and service, whether on-premises or in the cloud, needs to be designed with security in mind. There's too much at risk. For example, a denial-of-service attack might prevent customers from reaching your website or services and block you from doing business. Or, your website might be defaced, causing damage to your reputation. A data breach would be even worse, because it can ruin hard-earned trust while causing significant personal and financial harm.

Tailwind Traders specializes in competitive pricing, fast shipping, and a large range of items. It's looking at cloud technologies to improve business operations and support growth into new markets. By moving to the cloud, the company plans to enhance its shopping experience to further differentiate itself from competitors.


How will Tailwind Traders secure its networks?

As Tailwind Traders moves to the cloud, it needs to evaluate its security needs before it can deploy a single line of code to production.

Although security must be considered at every layer in the company's applications (all the way from the physical servers to the application data), some factors relate specifically to the network configuration and network traffic of cloud-based workloads.

In this module, you'll focus on the network security capabilities in Azure and review how they help you secure your solutions in the cloud, based on your business needs.
