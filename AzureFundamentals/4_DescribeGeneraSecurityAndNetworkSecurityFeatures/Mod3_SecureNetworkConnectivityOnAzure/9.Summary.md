Summary

1 minute

In this module, you learned about some of the ways you can secure network traffic both on Azure and in your on-premises datacenter.

<em>Defense in depth</em> is the overriding theme. Think about security as a multiple-layer, multiple-vector concern. Threats come from places we don't expect, and they can come with surprising strength.

Tailwind Traders now has a few tools and services that it can use to secure its networks. Here's a brief summary:
* Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that helps protect resources in Azure virtual networks.
* An Azure virtual network is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own datacenter. It enables virtual machines and other compute resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
* A network security group (NSG) enables you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within a virtual network.
* Azure DDoS Protection helps protect Azure resources from DDoS attacks.
