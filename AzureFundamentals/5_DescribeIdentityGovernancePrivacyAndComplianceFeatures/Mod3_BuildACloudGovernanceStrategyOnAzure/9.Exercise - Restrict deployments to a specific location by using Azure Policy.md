Exercise - Restrict deployments to a specific location by using Azure Policy

8 minutes

In this exercise, you create a policy in Azure Policy that restricts the deployment of Azure resources to a specific location. You verify the policy by attempting to create a storage account in a location that violates the policy.

Tailwind Traders wants to limit the location where resources can be deployed to the East US region. It has two reasons:

* **Improved cost tracking**
    * To track costs, Tailwind Traders uses different subscriptions to track deployments to each of its regional locations. The policy will ensure that all resources are deployed to the East US region.
* **Adhere to data residency and security compliance**
    * Tailwind Traders must adhere to a compliance rule that states where customer data can be stored. Here, customer data must be stored in the **East US** region.

Recall that you can assign a policy to a management group, a single subscription, or a resource group. Here, you assign the policy to a resource group so that policy doesn't affect any other resources in your Azure subscription.

    Important
    You need your own Azure subscription to complete the exercises in this module. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can still read along.

**Create the resource group**

Here you create a resource group that's named my-test-rg. This is the resource group to which you'll apply your location policy.

For learning purposes, you use the same resource group name that you used in the previous exercise. You can use the same name because you deleted the previous resource group.
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and sign in.
2. Select Create a resource.
3. Enter resource group in the search box, and select Enter.
4. If you're taken to a search results page, select Resource group from the results.
5. Select Create. Then fill in these fields.
Setting  |   Value
------------- | -------------
Subscription   |  (Your Azure subscription)
Subscription > Resource group  |   my-test-rg
Region  |   (US) East US
6. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.


**Explore predefined policies**
Before you configure your location policy, let's take a brief look at some predefined policies. As an example, you'll look at policies that relate to Azure Compute services.
1. From the Azure portal, at the top of the page, select Home to return to the start page.
2. At the top of the page, enter policy in the search bar. Then select Policy from the list of results to access Azure Policy.
3. Under Authoring, select Definitions.
4. From the Category drop-down list, select only Compute.

Notice that the Allowed virtual machine SKUs definition enables you to specify a set of virtual machine SKUs that your organization can deploy.

As an optional step, explore any other policies or categories that interest you.

**Configure the location policy**
Here you configure the allowed location policy by using Azure Policy. Then you assign that policy to your resource group. To do so:
1. From the Policy page, under Authoring, select Assignments.

An assignment is a policy that has been assigned to take place within a specific scope. For example, a definition could be assigned to the subscription scope.
2. Select Assign Policy.

You're taken to the Assign policy page.

3. Under Scope, select the ellipsis.
From the dialog box that appears, set:
a. The Subscription field to your Azure subscription.
b. The Resource Group field to my-test-rg.
c. Select the Select button.

4. Under Policy definition, select the ellipsis.
a. In the search bar, enter location.
b. Select the Allowed locations definition.
c. Select the Select button.

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/media/9-available-definitions-pane.png)

This policy definition specifies the location into which all resources must be deployed. If a different location is chosen, deployment will fail.

5. Select Next to move to the Parameters tab.
6. From the Allowed locations drop-down box, select East US.
7. Select Review + create, and then select Create.
You see that the Allowed locations policy assignment is now listed on the Policy | Assignments pane. It enforces the policy on the my-test-rg resource group.

**Verify the location policy**

Here you attempt to add a storage account to your resource group at a location that violates your location policy.
1. From the Azure portal, at the top of the page, select Home to return to the start page.
2. Select Create a resource.
3. Enter storage account in the search box, and select Enter.
4. If you're taken to a search results page, select Storage account from the results.
5. Select Create. Then fill in these fields.

        Note
        Replace NNN with a series of numbers. Numbers help to ensure that your storage account name is unique.

Setting  |   Value
------------- | -------------
Subscription   |  (Your Azure subscription)
Subscription > Resource group  |   my-test-rg
Storage account name  |   mysaNNN
Location  |   (Asia Pacific) Japan East
Performance   |  Standard
Account kind  |   StorageV2 (general purpose v2)
Replication  |   Locally redundant storage (LRS)
Access tier (default)   |  Hot

If you previously selected Japan East in your location policy, select a different region from the list.

6. Select Review + create, and then select Create.

You see a message that states that the deployment failed because of the policy violation. You also see the deployment details.

Here's an example that shows the deployment details for a storage account named mysa1234.

**Delete the policy assignment**

You no longer need your policy assignment. Here you remove it from your subscription.
1. From the Azure portal, select Home > Policy.
2. Under Authoring, select Assignments.
3. On the Allowed locations row, select the ellipsis. Then select Delete assignment. When prompted, select Yes.

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/media/10-policy-delete-assignment.png)

You see that the Allowed locations policy assignment no longer exists.

As an optional step, you can try to create the storage account a second time to verify that the policy is no longer in effect.

**Delete the resource group**

You no longer need your resource group. Here you remove it from your subscription.

1. From the Azure portal, select Home > Resource groups > my-test-rg to go to your resource group.
2. Select Overview, and then select Delete resource group.
3. At the prompt, enter my-test-rg, and then select OK.
    * The deletion operation might take a few moments to complete.
4. After the operation completes, select Home > Resource groups.
     *You see that the my-test-rg resource group no longer exists in your account.

Great work! You've successfully applied a policy by using Azure Policy to restrict the deployment of Azure resources to a specific location. You can now apply the policies that you need at the management group, subscription, or resource group level.
