Consider the following scenario. Then choose the best response for each question that follows, and select Check your answers.

Tailwind Traders has created environments for development and testing for its e-commerce system.

Here's a diagram that shows the basic compute, database, and networking components found in each environment.

A diagram of the development and test environments. Each environment contains virtual machines, a database, and a virtual network. The development environment includes three virtual machines. The test environment contains six virtual machines.

These environments provide a way for the team to build and test new application features. If you've gone through the [Plan and manage your Azure costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/plan-manage-azure-costs/) module, then you've already seen this layout.

Although the development and test teams report to different departments, both environments exist under the same Azure subscription.

The IT manager wants to implement governance controls to help ensure that only authorized users can access these systems. 

Having these controls in place will also help them track and manage operating costs.

1. How can Tailwind Traders allow some users to control the virtual machines in each environment but prevent them from modifying networking and other resources in the same resource group or Azure subscription?

* Create a role assignment through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).
    * Azure RBAC enables you to create roles that define access permissions. You might create one role that limits access only to virtual machines and a second role that provides administrators with access to everything.

Create a policy in Azure Policy that audits resource usage.



Split the environment into separate resource groups.
2. Which is the best way for Tailwind Traders to ensure that the team deploys only cost-effective virtual machine SKU sizes?

* Create a policy in Azure Policy that specifies the allowed SKU sizes.
   * After you enable this policy, that policy is applied when you create new virtual machines or resize existing ones. Azure Policy also evaluates any current virtual machines in your environment.

Periodically inspect the deployment manually to see which SKU sizes are used.

Create an Azure RBAC role that defines the allowed virtual machine SKU sizes.

3. Which is likely the best way for Tailwind Traders to identify which billing department each Azure resource belongs to?

Track resource usage in a spreadsheet.

Split the deployment into separate Azure subscriptions, where each subscription belongs to its own billing department.

* Apply a tag to each resource that includes the associated billing department.
    *   Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. The team might create a tag that's named BillingDept whose value would be the name of the billing department. You can use Azure Policy to ensure that the proper tags are assigned when resources are provisioned.
