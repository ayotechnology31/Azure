**Exercise - Protect a storage account from accidental deletion by using a resource lock**

8 minutes

In this exercise, you see how resource locks help prevent accidental deletion of your Azure resources.

To do so, you create a resource group from the Azure portal. Think of a resource group as a container for related Azure resources. Then you add a lock to your resource group and verify that you can't delete the resource group.

You then add a storage account to your resource group and see how the lock from the parent resource group prevents the storage account from being deleted. A storage account is a container that groups a set of Azure Storage services together.
    
    Important
    You need your own Azure subscription to complete the exercises in this module. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can still read along.

**Create the resource group**

Here you create a resource group that's named my-test-rg.
1. Go to the Azure portal and sign in.
2. At the top of the page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select + **New**. The **Create a resource group** page appears.
4. In the **Basics** tab, fill in the following fields.

**Setting** **  **Value**
------------- | -------------
Project details    
Subscription   |  Your Azure subscription
Resource group  |   **my-test-rg**
Resource details    
Region  |   (US) East US

You can also select a region that's closer to you.

5. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.


**Add a lock to the resource group**

Add a resource lock to the resource group. To do so:
1. From the Azure portal, select your resource group, **my-test-rg**.
2. Under Settings, select Locks, and then select Add.

3. Fill in these fields.
**Setting**  |   **Value**
------------- | -------------
Lock name  |   rg-delete-lock
Lock type  |   Delete
4. Select **OK**.

You see that the resource lock is applied to your resource group.

**Verify that the resource group is protected from deletion**

Here, you verify protection by attempting to delete the resource group.

1. From the top of the page, select my-test-rg to go to your resource group's overview page.

2. Select **Delete resource group**.

3. At the prompt, enter my-test-rg, and then select OK.

You see a message that tells you that the resource group is locked and can't be deleted.

**Protect a storage account from accidental deletion**

Here, you add a storage account to your resource group and see how the lock from the parent resource group prevents the storage account from being deleted. To do so:
1. From the Azure portal, at the top of the page, select Home to return to the start page.
2. Select Storage accounts. Then select + New. The Create storage account page appears.
3. In the Basics tab, fill in the following fields.
 
        Note
        Replace NNN with a series of numbers. The numbers help to ensure that your storage account name is unique.

**Setting**  |  **Value**
------------- | -------------
Project details    
Subscription    |  Your Azure subscription
Resource group    |  my-test-rg
Instance details    
Storage account name   |   mysaNNN
Location   |   (US) East US
Performance   |   Standard
Account kind   |   StorageV2 (general purpose v2)
Replication   |   Locally redundant storage (LRS)

As before, you can also select a region that's closer to you.

4. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.

The deployment might take a few moments to complete.

5. Select **Go to resource**.
6. At the top of the page, select **Delete**.

You see a message that tells you the resource or its parent is locked and can't be deleted. Here's an example that shows the error message for a storage account that's named **mysa1234**.

Although you didn't create a lock specifically for the storage account, the lock you created for the parent resource group prevents you from deleting the resource. In other words, the storage account inherits the lock from the parent resource group.


**Delete the resource group and the storage account**
You no longer need your resource group or storage account. Here you remove both.

When you delete a resource group, you also delete its child resources, such as the storage account you previously created.

To delete the resource group, you first need to remove the resource lock.
1. From the Azure portal, select **Home > Resource groups > my-test-rg** to go to your resource group.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Locks**.
3. Locate **rg-delete-lock**, and select **Delete** on that same row.
4. Select **Overview**, and then select **Delete resource group**.
5. At the prompt, enter **my-test-rg**, and then select **OK**.

The deletion operation might take a few moments to complete.

6. When the operation completes, select **Home > Resource **groups.

You see that the my-test-rg resource group no longer exists in your account. Your storage account is also deleted.

Nice work. You can now apply resource locks to help prevent the accidental deletion of your Azure resources.
