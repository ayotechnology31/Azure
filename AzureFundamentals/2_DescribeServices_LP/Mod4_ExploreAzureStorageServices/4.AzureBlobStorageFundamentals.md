Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob Storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. Blob Storage can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads, massive amounts of video data, constantly growing log files, and can be reached from anywhere with an internet connection.

Blobs aren't limited to common file formats. A blob could contain gigabytes of binary data streamed from a scientific instrument, an encrypted message for another application, or data in a custom format for an app you're developing. One advantage of blob storage over disk storage is that it does not require developers to think about or manage disks; data is uploaded as blobs, and Azure takes care of the physical storage needs.
Blob Storage is ideal for:
* Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
* Storing files for distributed access.
* Streaming video and audio.
* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
* Storing up to 8 TB of data for virtual machines.

You store blobs in containers, which helps you organize your blobs depending on your business needs.

The following diagram illustrates how you might use Azure accounts, containers, and blobs.
