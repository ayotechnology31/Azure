**Introduction**

5 minutes

Imagine you work for the motor vehicle department of a governmental organization. The department runs several public websites that enable drivers to register their vehicles, and renew their driver's license online.

The vehicle registration website has been running on a single server, and has suffered multiple outages because of server failures. This has resulted in frustrated drivers trying to register their vehicles by month's end before their registrations expire.

The department would like to improve resiliency by adding multiple web servers to its site, and distribute the load across them. 
They would also like to centralize their site on a single load-balancing service to simplify the URLs for site visitors.
