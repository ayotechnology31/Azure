**Exercise - Create web sites**

10 minutes

In the motor vehicle department system, you decide to run the web app on two servers. You'll implement each server using a virtual machine.

In this exercise, you'll create a pair of virtual machines and install the vehicle registration web app. You'll also configure a virtual network that Application Gateway can use to connect to the virtual machines. Finally, you'll deploy the license renewal web site to an instance of Azure App Service.

**Create virtual machines and deploy the vehicle registration site**
1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell in your browser, and log in to the directory with access to the subscription you want to create resources in.
2. Run the following command in the Cloud Shell to create a variable to store your resource group name, and a resource group for your resources. Replace <resource group name> with a name for your resource group, and <location> with the Azure region you'd like to deploy your resources in.

        Note
        If you need to find the location name, you can use the following command: az account list-locations -o table
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        RG=<resource group name>
        az group create --name $RG --location <location>

3. In the Cloud Shell window on the right, run the following command. This command uses the Azure command-line interface to create a virtual network named vehicleappvnet. It's a private network that provides addresses in the range 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255. The command also creates a subnet called webServerSubnet, with the address range 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255. This subnet will contain the virtual machines.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet create \
          --resource-group $RG \
          --name vehicleAppVnet \
          --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
          --subnet-name webServerSubnet \
          --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24

4. To download the script that creates the virtual machines, run the following command.

        Bash

        Copy
        git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-load-balance-web-traffic-with-application-gateway module-files

5. To create and configure the virtual machines for the web servers, run the following commands. The virtual machines are called webServer1 and webServer2. Each virtual machine runs Ubuntu Server. An administrative user account is created for each virtual machine, with the login name azureuser. Each virtual machine has the vehicle registration web app installed.

The first command runs asynchronously to enable both virtual machines to be created simultaneously.

    Azure CLI

    Copy
    az vm create \
      --resource-group $RG \
      --name webServer1 \
      --image UbuntuLTS \
      --admin-username azureuser \
      --generate-ssh-keys \
      --vnet-name vehicleAppVnet \
      --subnet webServerSubnet \
      --public-ip-address "" \
      --nsg "" \
      --custom-data module-files/scripts/vmconfig.sh \
      --no-wait


    Azure CLI

    Copy
    az vm create \
      --resource-group $RG \
      --name webServer2 \
      --image UbuntuLTS \
      --admin-username azureuser \
      --generate-ssh-keys \
      --vnet-name vehicleAppVnet \
      --subnet webServerSubnet \
      --public-ip-address "" \
      --nsg "" \
      --custom-data module-files/scripts/vmconfig.sh

6. To confirm both virtual machines were created successfully, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm list \
          --resource-group $RG \
          --show-details \
          --output table

You should see output similar to the following. Before continuing, ensure the PowerState is VM running for both virtual machines.

    Output

    Copy
    Name          ResourceGroup      PowerState    PublicIps    Fqdns    Location        Zones
    ------------  -----------------  ------------  -----------  -------  --------------  -------
    webServer1    MyResourceGroup    VM running                          southcentralus
    webServer2    MyResourceGroup    VM running                          southcentralus

You've now created the virtual machines running the vehicle registration web app. Both virtual machines are identical, and are part of the same virtual network.


**Create App Service and deploy the license renewal site**

1. To start, to generate a unique name for the website, run the following command.
        Bash

        Copy
        APPSERVICE="licenserenewal$RANDOM"

2. Next, to create the App Service plan the web app will use, run the following command.
        
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az appservice plan create \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --name vehicleAppServicePlan \
            --sku S1
3. Lastly, create the web app and deploy the license renewal site.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az webapp create \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --name $APPSERVICE \
            --plan vehicleAppServicePlan \
            --deployment-source-url https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-load-balance-web-traffic-with-application-gateway \
            --deployment-source-branch appService --runtime "DOTNETCORE|2.1" 


Now, let's take a closer look at configuring Application Gateway.
