**Exercise - Create a storage account using the Azure portal**

7 minutes

This module requires a sandbox to complete. A sandbox gives you access to free resources. Your personal subscription will not be charged. The sandbox may only be used to complete training on Microsoft Learn. Use for any other reason is prohibited, and may result in permanent loss of access to the sandbox.

In this unit, you'll use the Azure portal to create a storage account that is appropriate for a fictitious southern California surf report web app.

The surf report site lets users upload photos and videos of local beach conditions. Viewers will use the content to help them choose the beach with the best surfing conditions. Your list of design and feature goals is:
* Video content must load quickly.
* The site must handle unexpected spikes in upload volume.
* Outdated content must be removed as surf conditions change so the site always shows current conditions.

To fulfill these requirements, you decide to buffer uploaded content in an Azure Queue for processing, and then transfer it to an Azure Blob for persistent storage. You need a storage account that can hold both queues and blobs while delivering low-latency access to your content.


**Create a storage account using Azure portal**
1. Sign into the Azure portal using the same account you activated the sandbox with.

2. On the Azure portal menu, or from the Home page, select Create a resource.

3. In the left menu pane, select Storage, and then search for and select Storage account. The Storage account pane appears.

4. On the Basics tab, enter the following values for each setting.

5. Select Create. The Create storage account pane appears. On the Basics tab, enter the following values for each setting.

Setting   |   Value
------------- | -------------
Project details    
Subscription    |  Concierge Subscription
Resource group  |    ("[sandbox resource group name]") from the dropdown.
Instance details    
Storage account name    |  The name will be used to generate the public URL used to access the data in the account. The name must be unique across all existing storage account names in Azure. Names must be 3 to 24 characters long and can contain only lowercase letters and numbers.
Location     | Select a location near to you in the dropdown.
Performance     | Standard. This option decides the type of disk storage used to hold the data in the Storage account. Standard uses traditional hard disks, and Premium uses solid-state drives (SSD) for faster access.
Account kind  |    StorageV2 (general purpose v2)
Redundancy    |  Locally redundant storage (LRS). In our case, the images and videos quickly become out-of-date and are removed from the site. As a result, there's little value to paying extra for global redundancy. If a catastrophic event results in data loss, you can restart the site with fresh content from your users.

The free sandbox allows you to create resources in a subset of the Azure global regions. Select a region from the following list when you create resources:
* West US 2
* South Central US
* Central US
* East US
* West Europe
* Southeast Asia
* Japan East
* Brazil South
* Australia Southeast
* Central India


6. Select Next : Networking. Enter the following values for each setting.

Setting   |   Value
------------- | -------------
Network connectivity    
Connectivity method    |  Public endpoint (all networks). We want to allow public Internet access. Our content is public facing, and we need to allow access from public clients.
Network routing    
Routing preference   |   Microsoft network routing (default). We want to make use of the Microsoft global network that is optimized for low-latency path selection.

7. Select Next : Data protection. Enter the following value for the setting.
Setting    |  Value
------------- | -------------
Recovery    
Turn on soft delete for blobs    |  Disabled. Soft delete lets you recover your blob data in many cases where blobs or blob snapshots are deleted accidentally or overwritten.
Turn on soft delete for file shares   |   Disabled. File share soft delete lets you recover your blob data more easily at the folder level.

8. Select Next : Advanced. Enter the following values for each setting.
Setting   |   Value
------------- | -------------
Security    
Secure transfer required     | Enabled. This setting controls whether HTTP can be used for the REST APIs used to access data in the storage account. Setting this option to enable forces all clients to use SSL (HTTPS). Most of the time, you'll want to set this to enable as using HTTPS over the network is considered a best practice.
Minimum TLS version    |  Version 1.2 from dropdown. TLS 1.2 is the most secure version of TLS and is used by Azure Storage on public HTTPS endpoints. TLS 1.1 and 1.0 is supported for backwards compatibility. See Warning at end of table.
**Blob storage**
Allow Blob public access   |   Enabled. We'll allow clients to read data in that container without authorizing the request.
Blob access tier (default)   |   Hot. This setting is only used for Blob storage. The Hot Access Tier is ideal for frequently accessed data; the Cool Access Tier is better for infrequently accessed data. This setting only sets the default value. When you create a Blob, you can set a different value for the data. In our case, we want the videos to load quickly, so we'll use the high-performance option for our blobs.
**Data Lake Storage Gen 2s**    
Hierarchical namespace    |  Disabled. This is for big-data applications that aren't relevant to this module.
**Azure Files**
Large file shares   |   Disabled. Large file shares provide support up to a 100 TiB, however this type of storage account can't convert to a Geo-redundant storage offering, and upgrades are permanent.
 
     Warning
    If this option is enabled, it will enforce some additional restrictions. Azure files service connections without encryption will fail, including scenarios using SMB 2.1 or 3.0 on Linux. Because Azure storage doesn't support SSL for custom domain names, this option cannot be used with a custom domain name.

9. Select Next : Tags. Here, you associate key/value pairs to the account for your categorization and determine if a feature is available to any Azure resource.

10. Select Review + create to review the settings. This will do a quick validation of your options to make sure all the required fields are selected. If there are issues, they'll be reported here.
11. After validation passes, select Create to provision the storage account.

It may take two minutes to deploy the account.

12. After validation succeeds, select Go to resource to view your newly-created storage account.

You created a storage account with settings driven by your business requirements. For example, you might have selected a West US datacenter because your customers were primarily located in southern California. This is a typical flow: first analyze your data and goals, and then configure the storage account options to match.
