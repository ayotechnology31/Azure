Exercise - Create and manage network security groups

15 minutes

As the solution architect for the manufacturing company, you now want to start moving the ERP app and database servers to Azure. As a first step, you're going to test out your network security plan, using two of your servers.

In this unit, you'll configure a network security group and security rules to restrict network traffic to specific servers. You want your app server to be able to connect to your database server over HTTP. You don't want the database server to be able to use HTTP to connect to the app server.

    Important
    You need your own Azure subscription to run this exercise, and you might incur charges. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.

**Create a virtual network and network security group**

First, you'll create a resource group, the virtual network, and subnets for your server resources. You'll then create a network security group.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell in your browser, and log in to the directory with access to the subscription you want to create resources in. Use the Bash version of Cloud Shell.
2. To create a variable to store your resource group name, and a resource group for your resources, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command. Replace <resource group name> with a name for your resource group, and <location> with the Azure region you'd like to deploy your resources in.

Find the location name with the following command.

    Azure CLI

    Copy
        az account list-locations -o table
        
3. Next, create the resource group.
        
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        rg=<resource group name>

        az group create --name $rg --location <location>
        
4. To create the ERP-servers virtual network and the Applications subnet, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --name ERP-servers \
            --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
            --subnet-name Applications \
            --subnet-prefix 10.0.0.0/24

5. To create the Databases subnet, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.


        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet subnet create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --vnet-name ERP-servers \
            --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 \
            --name Databases

6. To create the ERP-SERVERS-NSG network security group, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.
       
       Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nsg create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --name ERP-SERVERS-NSG


**Create VMs running Ubuntu**

Next, you'll create two VMs called AppServer and DataServer. You deploy AppServer to the Applications subnet, and DataServer to the Databases subnet. Add the VM network interfaces to the ERP-SERVERS-NSG network security group. Then, to test your network security group, use these VMs.
1. To build the AppServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command. For the admin account, define a <password>.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-secure-and-isolate-with-nsg-and-service-endpoints/master/cloud-init.yml && \
        az vm create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --name AppServer \
            --vnet-name ERP-servers \
            --subnet Applications \
            --nsg ERP-SERVERS-NSG \
            --image UbuntuLTS \
            --size Standard_DS1_v2 \
            --admin-username azureuser \
            --custom-data cloud-init.yml \
            --no-wait \
            --admin-password <password>

2. To build the DataServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command. For the admin account, define a <password>.
    
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --name DataServer \
            --vnet-name ERP-servers \
            --subnet Databases \
            --nsg ERP-SERVERS-NSG \
            --size Standard_DS1_v2 \
            --image UbuntuLTS \
            --admin-username azureuser \
            --custom-data cloud-init.yml \
            --admin-password <password>
3. It can take several minutes for the VMs to be in a running state. To confirm that the VMs are running, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm list \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --show-details \
            --query "[*].{Name:name, Provisioned:provisioningState, Power:powerState}" \
            --output table

When your VM creation is complete, you should see the following output.

    Output

    Copy
    Name        Provisioned    Power
    ----------  -------------  ----------
    AppServer   Succeeded      VM running
    DataServer  Succeeded      VM running


**Check default connectivity**

Now, you'll try to open a Secure Shell (SSH) session to each of your VMs. Remember, so far you've deployed a network security group with default rules.
1. To connect to your VMs, use SSH directly from Cloud Shell. To do this, you need the public IP addresses that have been assigned to your VMs. To list the IP addresses that you'll use to connect to the VMs, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm list \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --show-details \
            --query "[*].{Name:name, PrivateIP:privateIps, PublicIP:publicIps}" \
            --output table

2. To make it easier to connect to your VMs during the rest of this exercise, assign the public IP addresses to variables. To save the public IP address of AppServer and DataServer to a variable, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Bash

        Copy
        APPSERVERIP="$(az vm list-ip-addresses \
                         --resource-group $rg \
                         --name AppServer \
                         --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress" \
                         --output tsv)"

        DATASERVERIP="$(az vm list-ip-addresses \
                         --resource-group $rg \
                         --name DataServer \
                         --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress" \
                         --output tsv)"
3. To check whether you can connect to your AppServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.
    
        Bash

        Copy
        ssh azureuser@$APPSERVERIP -o ConnectTimeout=5

You'll get a Connection timed out message.

4. To check whether you can connect to your DataServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh azureuser@$DATASERVERIP -o ConnectTimeout=5

You'll get the same connection failure message.

4. Remember that the default rules deny all inbound traffic into a virtual network, unless this traffic is coming from the same virtual network. The Deny All Inbound rule blocked the inbound SSH connections you just attempted.

**Inbound**
Name   |  Priority  |  Source IP  |   Destination IP |    Access
------------- | -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------
Allow VNet Inbound   |  65000   |  VIRTUAL_NETWORK |    VIRTUAL_NETWORK   v Allow
Deny All Inbound   |  65500   |  *  |   *   |  Deny


**Create a security rule for SSH**

As you've now experienced, the default rules in your ERP-SERVERS-NSG network security group include a Deny All Inbound rule. You'll now add a rule so that you can use SSH to connect to AppServer and DataServer.

1. To create a new inbound security rule to enable SSH access, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nsg rule create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --nsg-name ERP-SERVERS-NSG \
            --name AllowSSHRule \
            --direction Inbound \
            --priority 100 \
            --source-address-prefixes '*' \
            --source-port-ranges '*' \
            --destination-address-prefixes '*' \
            --destination-port-ranges 22 \
            --access Allow \
            --protocol Tcp \
            --description "Allow inbound SSH"

2. To check whether you can now connect to your AppServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh azureuser@$APPSERVERIP -o ConnectTimeout=5

The network security group rule might take a minute or two to take effect. If you receive a connection failure message, try again.

3. You should now be able to connect. After the Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? message, enter yes.

4. Enter the password you used when you created the VM.

5. Close the AppServer session, enter exit.
6. To check whether you can now connect to your DataServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh azureuser@$DATASERVERIP -o ConnectTimeout=5

7. You should now be able to connect. After the Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? message, enter yes.
8. Enter the password you used when you created the VM.
9. To close the DataServer session, enter exit.

**Create a security rule to prevent web access**

Now, add a rule so that AppServer can communicate with DataServer over HTTP, but DataServer can't communicate with AppServer over HTTP. These are the internal IP addresses for these servers:

Server name  |   IP address
------------- | -------------
AppServer    |  10.0.0.4 
DataServer   |   10.0.1.4

1. To create a new inbound security rule to deny HTTP access over port 80, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nsg rule create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --nsg-name ERP-SERVERS-NSG \
            --name httpRule \
            --direction Inbound \
            --priority 150 \
            --source-address-prefixes 10.0.1.4 \
            --source-port-ranges '*' \
            --destination-address-prefixes 10.0.0.4 \
            --destination-port-ranges 80 \
            --access Deny \
            --protocol Tcp \
            --description "Deny from DataServer to AppServer on port 80"


**Test HTTP connectivity between virtual machines**

Here, you'll check if your new rule works. AppServer should be able to communicate with DataServer over HTTP. DataServer shouldn't be able to communicate with AppServer over HTTP.
1. To connect to your AppServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command. Check if AppServer can communicate with DataServer over HTTP.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -t azureuser@$APPSERVERIP 'wget http://10.0.1.4; exit; bash'

2. Enter the password you used when you created the VM.

3. The response should include a 200 OK message.
4. To connect to your DataServer VM, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command. Check if DataServer can communicate with AppServer over HTTP.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -t azureuser@$DATASERVERIP 'wget http://10.0.0.4; exit; bash'

5. Enter the password you used when you created the VM.

6. This shouldn't succeed, because you've blocked access over port 80. After several minutes, you should get a Connection timed out message. To stop the command before the timeout, press Ctrl+C.


**Deploy an app security group**

Next, create an app security group for database servers, so that all servers in this group can be assigned the same settings. You're planning to deploy more database servers, and want to prevent these servers from accessing app servers over HTTP. By assigning sources in the app security group, you don't need to manually maintain a list of IP addresses in the network security group. Instead, you assign the network interfaces of the VMs you want to manage to the app security group.

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-and-isolate-with-nsg-and-service-endpoints/media/3-exercise-second-task.svg)

1. To create a new app security group called ERP-DB-SERVERS-ASG, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network asg create \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --name ERP-DB-SERVERS-ASG

2. To associate DataServer with the app security group, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nic ip-config update \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --application-security-groups ERP-DB-SERVERS-ASG \
            --name ipconfigDataServer \
            --nic-name DataServerVMNic \
            --vnet-name ERP-servers \
            --subnet Databases

3. To update the HTTP rule in the ERP-SERVERS-NSG network security group, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command. It should reference the ERP-DB-Servers app security group.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nsg rule update \
            --resource-group $rg \
            --nsg-name ERP-SERVERS-NSG \
            --name httpRule \
            --direction Inbound \
            --priority 150 \
            --source-address-prefixes "" \
            --source-port-ranges '*' \
            --source-asgs ERP-DB-SERVERS-ASG \
            --destination-address-prefixes 10.0.0.4 \
            --destination-port-ranges 80 \
            --access Deny \
            --protocol Tcp \
            --description "Deny from DataServer to AppServer on port 80 using application security group"

**Test the updated HTTP security rule**
1. To connect to your AppServer VM. in the Cloud Shell, run the following command. Check if AppServer can communicate with DataServer over HTTP.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -t azureuser@$APPSERVERIP 'wget http://10.0.1.4; exit; bash'

2. Enter the password you used when you created the VM.

3. As before, the response should include a 200 OK message. The app security group settings can take a minute or two to take effect. If you don't initially receive the 200 OK message, wait a minute and try again.

4. To connect to your DataServer in the Cloud Shell (at the top-right in Azure; the box with the >_) , run the following command. Check if DataServer can communicate with AppServer over HTTP.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -t azureuser@$DATASERVERIP 'wget http://10.0.0.4; exit; bash'

5. Enter the password you used when you created the VM.

6. As before, this shouldn't succeed, because you've blocked access over port 80. After several minutes, you should get a Connection timed out message. To stop the command before the timeout, press Ctrl+C.

You've now confirmed that your network security group rule works using an app security group, in the same way as when you used a source IP address. If we were to add additional data servers, you can easily ensure they have the proper network security by adding the new servers to the ERP-DB-SERVERS-ASG.
