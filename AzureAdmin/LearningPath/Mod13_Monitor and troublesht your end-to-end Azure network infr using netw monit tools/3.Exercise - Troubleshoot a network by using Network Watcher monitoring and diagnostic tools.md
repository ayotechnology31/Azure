**Exercise - Troubleshoot a network by using Network Watcher monitoring and diagnostic tools**

7 minutes

Azure Network Watcher helps you diagnose configuration errors that prevent virtual machines (VMs) from communicating.

Suppose you have two VMs that can't communicate. You want to diagnose the problem and resolve it as fast as possible. You want to use Network Watcher to do that.

Here, you'll troubleshoot connectivity between two VMs in different subnets.

    Important
    You need your own Azure subscription to run this exercise, and you might incur charges. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.

**Configure a virtual network and VMs**

Let's start by creating the problematic infrastructure, which includes a configuration error:

1. In your browser, open the Azure Cloud Shell, and log in to the directory with access to the subscription you want to create resources in.

2. To create a variable to store your resource group name, and a resource group for your resources, in the Bash Cloud Shell, run the following command. Replace <resource group name> with a name for your resource group, and <location> with the Azure region you'd like to deploy your resources in.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        RG=<resource group name>

        az group create --name $RG --location <location>

3. To create the virtual network MyVNet1 and the subnet FrontendSubnet, in Azure Cloud Shell, run this command.
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet create \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --name MyVNet1 \
            --address-prefix 10.10.0.0/16 \
            --subnet-name FrontendSubnet \
            --subnet-prefix 10.10.1.0/24

4. To create the subnet called BackendSubnet, run this command.
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet subnet create \
            --address-prefixes 10.10.2.0/24 \
            --name BackendSubnet \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --vnet-name MyVNet1
 
         Note
        If you get an error, "partofthepassword: event not found; create a new password and avoid ! marks.

5. To deploy a VM in FrontendSubnet, run this command. Replace <password> with a complex password of your choice.
    
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm create \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --name FrontendVM \
            --vnet-name MyVNet1 \
            --subnet FrontendSubnet \
            --image Win2019Datacenter \
            --admin-username azureuser \
            --admin-password <password>

6. To install IIS on FrontendVM, run this command.
    
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm extension set \
            --publisher Microsoft.Compute \
            --name CustomScriptExtension \
            --vm-name FrontendVM \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --settings '{"commandToExecute":"powershell.exe Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server"}' \
            --no-wait
7. To deploy a virtual machine in BackendSubnet, run this command. Replace <password> with a complex password of your choice.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm create \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --name BackendVM \
            --vnet-name MyVNet1 \
            --subnet BackendSubnet \
            --image Win2019Datacenter \
            --admin-username azureuser \
            --admin-password <password>

8. To install IIS on BackendVM, run this command.
    
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm extension set \
            --publisher Microsoft.Compute \
            --name CustomScriptExtension \
            --vm-name BackendVM \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --settings '{"commandToExecute":"powershell.exe Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server"}' \
            --no-wait
9. To create a network security group (NSG), run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nsg create \
            --name MyNsg \
            --resource-group $RG
10. To create an NSG configuration mistake that prevents communication between the VMs, run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nsg rule create \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --name MyNSGRule \
            --nsg-name MyNsg \
            --priority 4096 \
            --source-address-prefixes '*' \
            --source-port-ranges '*' \
            --destination-address-prefixes '*' \
            --destination-port-ranges 80 443 3389 \
            --access Deny \
            --protocol TCP \
            --direction Inbound \
            --description "Deny from specific IP address ranges on 80, 443 and 3389."

11. To associate a network security group with a subnet, run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet subnet update \
            --resource-group $RG \
            --name BackendSubnet \
            --vnet-name MyVNet1 \
            --network-security-group MyNsg

**Enable Network Watcher for your region**

Now, to set up Network Watcher in the same region as the infrastructure, let's use the Azure CLI.

To enable Network Watcher, run this command. Replace (match) <location> with the Azure region you created your resource group.

    Azure CLI

    Copy
    az network watcher configure \
        --locations <location> \
        --enabled true \
        --resource-group $RG
        
        
**Use Network Watcher to show the topology**

Now, you can use Network Watcher to troubleshoot connectivity between two VMs in different subnets. Your colleague has reported a connectivity issue over HTTP/HTTPS between the two VMs. First, investigate the network topology.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. On the Azure portal menu, select All services. Then, search for Network Watcher. The Network Watcher panel appears.
3. In the left nav bar, in the Monitoring section, select Topology. The Network Watcher | Topology panel appears.
4. In the dropdowns, select your Subscription and Resource Group for this exercise. Network Watcher displays your network topology.

**Use Connection Monitor to run tests from the back end to the front end**

The topology appears to be correct. To get more information, let's set up some tests in Connection Monitor. Start by creating a test from the back-end VM to the front-end VM.
1. Under Monitoring, select Connection monitor. The Network Watcher | Connection monitor panel appears.

2. From the top menu bar, select Create. The Create Connection Monitor page appears.

3. On the Basics tab, fill in the following values.

Setting  |   Value
------------- | -------------
Connection Monitor Name  |   Back-to-front-HTTP-test
Subscription |    From the dropdown, select your subscription
Region  |   Select the Azure region you deployed your resources in

4. Select Next : Test groups. The Add test group details panel appears.
5. Fill in the following values.

Setting    |  Value
------------- | -------------
Test group name   |   Back-to-front-HTTP-test-group
Sources box    |  Select Add sources

6. The Add Sources panel appears. On the Azure endpoints tab, select VNET, ensure your subscription is selected, and then select MyVNet1 from the list.

7. At the bottom of the panel, expand Selected sources (2 Azure endpoints). The BackendVM and FrontendVM Azure endpoints appear.
8. At the far right of each endpoint, select the ellipsis, and then select Enable Network Watcher. Wait for each endpoint to deploy.

9. Select BackendVM from the expanded Azure endpoint list.

10. Select Add endpoints. The Add test group details panel reappears with the BackendSubnet identified as your source.
11. In the Test configurations box, select Add Test configuration. The Add Test configuration panel appears.
12. On the New configuration tab, fill in the following values.

Setting   |   Value
------------- | -------------
Test configuration name   |   Back-to-front-HTTP-test-configuration
Protocol   |   HTTP
Destination port   |   80
Test Frequency   |   Every 30 seconds
Maintain the default values for the remaining settings    


13. Select Add Test configuration. The Add test group details reappears with your test configuration identified.
14. In the Destinations box, select Add destinations. The Add Destinations panel appears. On the Azure endpoints tab, select VNET, ensure your subscription is selected, and then select MyVNet1 from the list.
15. At the bottom of the panel, expand Selected destinations (2 Azure endpoints). The BackendVM and FrontendVM Azure endpoints appear.
16. Select FrontendVM from the expanded Azure endpoint list.
17. Select Add endpoints. The Add test group details reappears with your with the FrontendSubnet identified as your destination.
18. At the bottom of the panel, select Add Test Group. The Create Connection Monitor panel reappears.
19. On the Test groups tab, notice that your test group is now listed.

The results should show that, because the NSG is associated with the back-end subnet, traffic flows without issues from the back-end VM to the front-end VM.


**Use Connection Monitor to run tests from the front end to the back end**

Run the same test in the opposite direction. Let's set up a test in Connection Monitor. Start by creating a test from the front-end VM to the back-end VM.

1. Under Monitoring, select Connection monitor. The Network Watcher | Connection monitor panel appears.
2. From the top menu bar, select Create. The Create Connection Monitor page appears.
3. On the Basics tab, fill in the following values.

9. Select FrontendVM from the expanded Azure endpoint list.

10. Select Add endpoints. The Add test group details panel reappears with the FrontendSubnet identified as your source.

11. In the Test configurations box, select Add Test configuration. The Add Test configuration panel appears.

12. On the New configuration tab, fill in the following values.

Setting  |   Value
------------- | -------------
Test configuration name  - |  Front-to-back-HTTP-test-configuration
Protocol   |  HTTP
Destination port  |    80
Test Frequency  |   Every 30 seconds
Maintain the default values for the remaining settings    

13. Select Add Test configuration. The Add test group details reappears with your test configuration identified.

14. In the Destinations box, select Add destinations. The Add Destinations panel appears. On the Azure endpoints tab, select VNET, ensure your subscription is selected, and then select MyVNet1 from the list.

15. At the bottom of the panel, expand Selected destinations (2 Azure endpoints). The BackendVM and FrontendVM Azure endpoints appear.

16. Select BackendVM from the expanded Azure endpoint list.

17. Select Add endpoints. The Add test group details reappears with your with the BackendSubnet identified as your destination.

18. At the bottom of the panel, select Add Test Group. The Create Connection Monitor panel reappears.

19. On the Test groups tab, notice that your test group is now listed.

The results should show that, because the NSG is associated with the back-end subnet, no traffic flows from the front-end VM to the back-end VM.



**Use IP flow verify to test the connection**

Let's use the IP flow verify tool to get more information.

1. On the Connection monitor panel, in the left nav bar, under Network diagnostic tools, select IP flow verify.
2. Configure the test with these values, and then select Check.

Setting  |   Value
------------- | -------------
Subscription   |  Select your subscription
Resource group  |   Select your resource group
Virtual machine  |  BackendVM
Network interface  |   BackendVMVMNic
Protocol  |   TCP
Direction |    Outbound
Local IP address  |   10.10.2.4
Local port  |   3389
Remote IP  |   10.10.1.4
Remote port   |  3389

![Screenshot that shows an IP flow test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/troubleshoot-azure-network-infrastructure/media/3-ip-flow-test.png)

3. Examine the results. They show that access is denied because of NSG and security rules.

In this exercise, you have successfully used Network Watcher tools to discover the connectivity issue between the two subnets. Communication is allowed one way but blocked the other way because of NSG rules.
