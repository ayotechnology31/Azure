**Exercise - Troubleshoot a network by using Network Watcher metrics and logs**

30 minutes

In Azure Network Watcher, metrics and logs can diagnose complex configuration issues.

Suppose you have two virtual machines (VMs) that can't communicate. You want to obtain as much information as you can to diagnose the problem.

In this unit, you'll troubleshoot by using Network Watcher metrics and logs. To diagnose the connectivity issue between the two VMs, you'll then use the network security group (NSG) flow logs.


Register the Microsoft.Insights provider

NSG flow logging requires the Microsoft.Insights provider. to register for that provider, complete the following steps.
1. Sign in to the Azure portal, and log in to the directory with access to the subscription you created resources in.
2. In theâ€¯Azure portal, search for, select Subscriptions, and then select your subscription.
3. In the left nav bar, under the Settings section, select Resource providers.
4. In the search bar, enter microsoft.insights.
5. If the status of the microsoft.insights provider is Unregistered, select Register.

**Create a storage account**

Now, create a storage account for the NSG flow logs.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the Home page, select Create a resource. Then, select Storage > Storage account, and then select Create. The Create storage account panel appears.

 2. On the Basics tab, fill in the following values for each setting.
Setting  |   Value
------------- | -------------
Project details    
Subscription   |  Select your subscription
Resource group    | Select your resource group
Instance details    
Storage account name  |   Create a unique name
Location |    Select the same region as your resource group
Performance   |  Standard
Account kind   |  StorageV2

3. Replication  |   Read-access geo-redundant storage
Go to the Advanced tab, and fill in this value.
Setting  |  Value
------------- | -------------
Blob storage    
Blob access tier (default)   | Hot

4. Select Review + create, and when validation passes, select Create.


**Create a Log Analytics workspace**

To view the NSG flow logs, you'll use Log Analytics.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the Home page, search for, and select Log Analytics workspaces. The Log Analytics workspaces panel appears.

2. On the top menu bar, select New. The Create Log Analytics workspace panel appears.
3. On the Basics tab, fill in these values for each setting.

Setting  |   Value
------------- | -------------
Project details    
Subscription  |   Select your subscription
Resource group  |   Select your resource group
Instance details    
Name   |  testsworkspace
Region  |  Select the same region as your resource group

4. Select Next : Pricing tier. On the Pricing tier tab, fill in the following values for each setting.
Setting   |  Value
------------- | -------------
Pricing tier    
Pricing tier |    Pay-as-you-go (Per GB)

5. Select Review + Create, and then select Create.


**Enable flow logs**

To set up flow logs, you must configure the NSG to connect to the storage account, and add traffic analytics for the NSG.
1. On the Azure portal menu, select All resources. Then, select the MyNSG network security group.
2. Under Monitoring, select NSG flow logs.
3. Select MyNSG, and then select On.
4. Under Storage account, select Configure. In the Storage account dropdown, select the storage account you created earlier. Then, select OK.
5. Under Traffic Analytics status, select On. In the Traffic Analytics processing interval dropdown, select Every 10 mins.
6. Select Log Analytics workspace, and then select testworkspace.
7. Select Save.


**Generate test traffic**

Now, you're ready to generate some network traffic between VMs to catch in the flow log.

1. On the Azure portal menu, select All resources, select FrontendVM, and then select Connect.
2. Select Download RDP File, and then select OK. If you see a warning about the publisher of the remote connection, select Connect.
3. Sign in with the username azureuser and the password you specified when you created the VM, and then select Yes.
4. Open a PowerShell prompt, and then run this command.

        PowerShell

        Copy
        Test-NetConnection 10.10.2.4 -port 80

The connection test fails after a few seconds.


**Diagnose the problem**

Now, let's use log analytics to view the NSG flow logs.

1. On the Azure portal menu, select All services. Then, select Networking > Network Watcher.
2. Under Logs, select Traffic Analytics.
3. In the Log Analytics workspace dropdown, select testworkspace.
4. Use the different views to diagnose the problem that prevents communication from the front end VM to the back end VM.


**Fix the problem**

An NSG rule is blocking inbound traffic to the back end subnet from everywhere over the ports 80, 443, and 3389 instead of just 
blocking inbound traffic from the Internet. Let's reconfigure that rule now.
1. On the Azure portal menu, select All resources, and then select MyNsg.
2. Under Settings, select Inbound security rules, and then select MyNSGRule.
3. Change Source to be Service Tag, and configure Source service tag to be Internet.
4. Select Save.


**Retest the connection**
Connections on port 80 should now work without problems.
1. In the RDP client, connect to FrontendVM. At the PowerShell prompt, run this command.

        PowerShell

        Copy
        Test-NetConnection 10.10.2.4 -port 80

The connection test should now succeed.
