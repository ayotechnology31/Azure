**Exercise - Secure access to files stored in Azure Files**

10 minutes

Sandbox activated! Time remaining:  

30 min

You have used 1 of 10 sandboxes for today. More sandboxes will be available tomorrow.

Azure provides several options to improve security and restrict access to file shares you've created.
The finance company you're working for wants to migrate existing data files from their on-premises file shares. Before moving these files to the cloud, the company wants to ensure that only their datacenter and branch offices can access them. To ensure security is in place, you'll enable secure transfers, and then allow access only from a specific set of IP addresses.

In this exercise, you'll check that secure transfers are enforced on the file shares you created previously. After checking, you'll add firewall rules to restrict access to a specific IP address, and then test that it can't be accessed from anywhere else. Finally, you'll create a snapshot of your file share that you can use to recover files.


**Enable secure file transfer**
1. Open your local browser to sign in to the Azure portal.
2. In the portal menu on the left, select Storage accounts.
3. Select the created storage account that should be named learnazurefileshare followed by random numbers.
4. Under Settings, select Configuration.

5. Check that Secure transfer required is enabled.


**Add a firewall rule to restrict access to an IP address**
1. Under Settings, select Networking > Firewalls and virtual networks.

2. Under Allow access from, select the Selected networks option.
3. Under Firewall, in the address range input, note the public IP address of your VM. You can see this address in the title bar of the remote desktop connection.
4. Select Save.

**Test security of the file share**
1. On your host machine, try to mount one of the network shares.
2. In your browser, sign in to the Azure portal.
3. In the portal menu on the left, select Storage Accounts.
4. Select the created storage account. It should be named learnazurefileshare followed by random numbers.
5. Select File shares.

![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the storage account overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/store-and-share-with-azure-files/media/4-select-file-shares.png)

6. You should see Access Denied.

![Screenshot showing access is denied to the share](*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/store-and-share-with-azure-files/media/6-access-denied.png)

7. Return to the Firewalls and virtual networks settings.
8. Select the Add your client IP address check box, and select Save.
9. Select Overview, and then select File shares.
10. Select the data file share. You can now browse the file share in your local browser.
 
         Note
        You might need to go to the reports share because the error page could be cached for the data file share.
11. Use the browser on your computer to download AzCopy by going to https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-windows.
12. Connect to your VM by using the remote desktop connection.
13. Open the file share in the Azure portal, upload the azcopy.exe file so it is available on the VM. On the VM drag to the desktop for easy use.

![Screenshot of expanding the AzCopy zip folder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/store-and-share-with-azure-files/media/6-unzip-azcopy.png)

14. Select the azcopy zip file.
15. On the menu, select Compressed Folder Tools, and then select Extract all.
16. In the Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders window, select Extract.
17. Select Start, select the Windows PowerShell folder, and then select Windows PowerShell.
18. Move to the folder that contains AzCopy.

        PowerShell

        Copy
        cd C:\Users\azureuser\Desktop
    
19. Run AzCopy to copy the files to Azure by first signing in to the sandbox.

        PowerShell

        Copy
        .\azcopy.exe login
 
         Note
        Due to security you now need to use an external web browser. You will need to type the URL into another device, your phone works well. Enter the code to complete the connection.

**Copy local files to Azure**
1. Create some local example test files by using PowerShell.

        PowerShell

        Copy
        1..100 | % { New-Item -Path F:\ -Name "$_.txt" -Value (Get-Date).toString() -ItemType file}

2. Sign in to the Azure portal.
3. In the portal menu on the left, select Storage Accounts.
4. Select the created storage account. It should be named learnazurefileshare followed by random numbers.
5. Under Settings, select Shared access signatures.
 ![Screenshot showing Shared access signatures.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/store-and-share-with-azure-files/media/6-sas-connection-string.png)

AzCopy requires a shared access signature (SAS) to authorize access to the share.

6. Select Generate SAS and connection string.
7. Copy the File service SAS URL.
8. Paste the connection string into Notepad, and add a path to the data share. Change the string by adding data/ to the path from:

        https://learnazurefileshare6438.file.core.windows.net/?sv=2019-02-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2019-12-05T20:46:09Z&st=2019-12-05T12:46:09Z&spr=https&sig=TW1ZMwzksKMhKMqJxSCMBy5wFmut7yuR3vNlTSwFhKQ%3D
to:
        
        https://learnazurefileshare6438.file.core.windows.net/data/?sv=2019-02-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2019-12-05T20:46:09Z&st=2019-12-05T12:46:09Z&spr=https&sig=TW1ZMwzksKMhKMqJxSCMBy5wFmut7yuR3vNlTSwFhKQ%3D

9. Use this new SAS connection string in the AzCopy command to copy the files to Azure. Run this command in the PowerShell window.

        PowerShell

        Copy
        .\azcopy copy "D:\*.txt" "https://learnazurefileshare6438.file.core.windows.net/data/?sv=2019-02-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2019-12-05T20:46:09Z&st=2019-12-05T12:46:09Z&spr=https&sig=TW1ZMwzksKMhKMqJxSCMBy5wFmut7yuR3vNlTSwFhKQ%3D" --recursive=true

10. You should see the following output from AzCopy.

        PowerShell

        Copy
        INFO: Scanning...

        Job fadb5656-752c-0e46-6a01-703c18c6fe17 has started

**Create a share snapshot**
1. In the Azure portal, in the portal menu on the left, select Storage Accounts.
2. Select the created storage account. It should be named learnazurefileshare followed by random numbers.
3. Select File shares, and then select the data share.
4. In the Operations section, select Snapshots.
5. Select + Add snapshot, and select OK.
6. Return to your VM, and open File Explorer.
7. Browse to the data share mounted at the F drive, right-click any of the text files, and select Properties.
8. In the File properties window, select Previous Versions, and note the listed snapshots created on the file share.
![Screenshot of the file properties window showing previous snapshots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/store-and-share-with-azure-files/media/6-previous-versions.png)

From here, you can select Open to open the previous version to browse the files at that snapshot. Otherwise, you can select Restore to restore files from a snapshot.
