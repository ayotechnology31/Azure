**Exercise - Create and connect to an Azure Files share**

10 minutes

Sandbox activated! Time remaining:  

46 min

You have used 1 of 10 sandboxes for today. More sandboxes will be available tomorrow.

Azure storage accounts enable organizations to replicate their on-premises file shares in a secure, resilient cloud service. Companies can then remove redundant hardware and infrastructure that support the internal SANs and NAS. At the same time, a company can reduce the risk of files being unavailable because of a hardware failure.

The finance company has asked you to duplicate the two file shares that they currently have on-premises. It uses one file share for reports and the other for application data. The storage account needs to be resilient to datacenter failures. That's why you'll create it to use GRS redundancy.

In this exercise, you'll first create a new storage account and two file shares for reports and application data. You'll then create a Windows VM to use as your example customer machine. You'll use the Windows VM to mount drives where you access the file shares. Finally, you'll map two drives to the new Azure file shares and copy reports to them.

**Create a GRS storage account**

1. Create a storage account by using the Azure CLI command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        export STORAGEACCT=learnazurefileshare$RANDOM

        az storage account create \
            --name $STORAGEACCT \
            --resource-group learn-a87fee39-155a-47a7-ad87-f82e09c1114a \
            --sku Standard_GRS

2. Using Azure CLI commands, save the storage account key in a local variable.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        STORAGEKEY=$(az storage account keys list \
            --resource-group learn-a87fee39-155a-47a7-ad87-f82e09c1114a \
            --account-name $STORAGEACCT \
            --query "[0].value" | tr -d '"')

**Create file shares**

1. Create a file share to store the finance company's reports.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az storage share create \
            --account-name $STORAGEACCT \
            --account-key $STORAGEKEY \
            --name "reports"

2. Create a file share to store the finance company's application data.
    
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az storage share create \
            --account-name $STORAGEACCT \
            --account-key $STORAGEKEY \
            --name "data"

**Create and connect to a Windows server**

Next, create a Windows Server VM to simulate an on-premises machine running in the finance company's datacenter or branch office.

1. Using Azure Cloud Shell, create a Windows VM with the Azure CLI. When you're prompted for a password, enter a complex password of your choice and note it for reference later.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm create \
            --resource-group learn-a87fee39-155a-47a7-ad87-f82e09c1114a \
            --name 2019FileServer \
            --image Win2019Datacenter \
            --admin-username azureuser

2. Sign in to the Azure portal with the account you used to activate the sandbox. On the portal menu, select All services > Virtual machines. Then select the 2019FileServer VM you created.

3. On the Overview pane, select Connect > RDP, and then select Download RDP File.
4. Run the RDP file, and select Connect when you're prompted.
5. On the Enter your credentials prompt, select More choices. Then select Use a different account. In the Username field, enter azureuser, and enter the password for this user.
6. Select OK, and then select Yes to connect to the server.


**Map drives to the Azure file shares**

1. In the Azure portal, select or search for Storage Accounts from the portal menu.
2. Select the created storage account that should be named learnazurefileshare, followed by random numbers.

3. Select File shares, and then select data (same page you just selected data).

4. Select Connect, and in the pop-up window on the right, select the F drive letter.

5. Copy the PowerShell command.

6. On your virtual machine, right-click Start and select Windows PowerShell (Admin).

7. In the PowerShell window, paste the copied commands.
8. Return to the Azure portal, go back to the file shares, and select the reports file share.

9. Select Connect, and in the pop-up window on the right, select the G drive letter.
10. Copy the bottom PowerShell command.
11. In the PowerShell window, paste the copied commands.


**Test the mounted drive**
1. Open Explorer in the VM , and select This PC.
![Explorer showing This PC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/store-and-share-with-azure-files/media/4-explorer-mapped-drives.png)

2. Select the data drive named drive F.
3. Right-click the main window, and select New > Text Document.
4. Name the file test upload.
5. Return to the Azure portal in your browser, and go to the data file share. You should see the file in the portal.
6. Keep this connection open for the next exercise.
