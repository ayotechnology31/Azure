**Introduction**

2 minutes

Azure Files provides a cloud-based file share for storing and sharing files. You then access these files from applications hosted in Azure App Service, an Azure VM, or an on-premises machine. Azure Files stores and shares file access between applications and systems in a secure and failure-resilient manner.

A financial company is moving an application to Azure that generates reports and data exports for users and other systems to consume. The company stores these reports and data exports on both NAS devices and Windows file shares. The files are stored this way so they can be easily shared between systems. The company wants to consolidate the storage of these files to a native cloud service. They want to continue to use Server Message Block (SMB) to access the files securely.

This module allows you to explore the file share options available. You'll complete hands-on exercises to move data stored in files into a storage account. Then you'll see how to use Azure Files to create secure SMB shares to access these files.

By the end of this module, you'll know what features of Azure Files are available. You'll have created storage accounts, added file shares, migrated data to them, and secured them. Finally, you'll see how you can take snapshots of files and use those snapshots on a Windows machine.
