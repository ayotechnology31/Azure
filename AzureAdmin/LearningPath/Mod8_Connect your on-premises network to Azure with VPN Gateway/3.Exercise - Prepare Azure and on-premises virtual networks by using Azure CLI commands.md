**Exercise - Prepare Azure and on-premises virtual networks by using Azure CLI commands**

Sandbox activated! Time remaining:

You have used 3 of 10 sandboxes for today. More sandboxes will be available tomorrow.

Your company is now ready to deploy a site-to-site VPN. This VPN will allow your on-premises servers to connect to resources in Azure. You can then start to securely share data from each of your sites, and you can use resources hosted in Azure across your organization.

You'll start by creating your Azure-side resources and on-premises network resources. For this deployment, you'll use the following network topology.

Network topology for unit 3 exercise

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/connect-on-premises-network-with-vpn-gateway/media/3-network-topology-used-in-exercise.svg)

In this exercise, you'll simulate an on-premises datacenter (HQ-Network) by using an additional Azure virtual network. There are many makes and models of on-premises VPN devices, and it won't be possible to describe their configuration in this unit. The logical method of configuration is the same for a VPN device. You just need to replace the steps for HQ-Network with steps tailored to your on-premises device.

In the previous diagram, notice that the local network gateway names in each location reflect the target networks rather than the source network. This is a good practice. It clarifies that the local network gateway refers to the other network that you're connecting to.

In this unit, you'll configure the virtual networks with a subnet, add a gateway subnet, and then create the local network gateway by using the Azure CLI.


**Create the Azure-side resources**

1. Run this command in Azure Cloud Shell to create the Azure-VNet-1 virtual network and the Services subnet.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name Azure-VNet-1 \
            --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
            --subnet-name Services \
            --subnet-prefix 10.0.0.0/24

2. Run this command in Cloud Shell to add the GatewaySubnet subnet to Azure-VNet-1.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet subnet create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --vnet-name Azure-VNet-1 \
            --address-prefix 10.0.255.0/27 \
            --name GatewaySubnet

3. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the LNG-HQ-Network local network gateway.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network local-gateway create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --gateway-ip-address 94.0.252.160 \
            --name LNG-HQ-Network \
            --local-address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/16

This gateway represents the on-premises network that you're connecting to. The IP address specified as the remote gateway (which is the simulated on-premises network) will need to be updated later because it doesn't exist yet in our scenario.


**Create the simulated on-premises network and supporting resources**
1. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the HQ-Network virtual network and the Applications subnet.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name HQ-Network \
            --address-prefix 172.16.0.0/16 \
            --subnet-name Applications \
            --subnet-prefix 172.16.0.0/24

2. Run this command in Cloud Shell to add GatewaySubnet to HQ-Network.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet subnet create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --address-prefix 172.16.255.0/27 \
            --name GatewaySubnet \
            --vnet-name HQ-Network

3. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the LNG-Azure-VNet-1 local network gateway.
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network local-gateway create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --gateway-ip-address 94.0.252.160 \
            --name LNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --local-address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16

 This gateway describes the Azure network that you're connecting to. You'll update the IP address specified as the remote gateway (which is in Azure) later.


**Verify the topology**
1. Run this command in Cloud Shell to verify that the virtual networks have been successfully created.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet list --output table

2. Run this command in Cloud Shell to verify that the local network gateways have been successfully created.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network local-gateway list \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --output table

The following diagram shows the resources that you've deployed.
