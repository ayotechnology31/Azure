**Summary**

1 minute

It's critical that healthcare providers have secure connectivity for passing patient healthcare information between datacenters and regional facilities. To achieve the goals of secure connectivity in a cost-effective way, you used VPN gateway options in Azure to connect on-premises networks to virtual networks in Azure. You learned about the resources you need to create VPN gateways and the limitations that apply to different VPN Gateway SKUs. You also learned how to create and configure site-to-site virtual network gateways.

**Clean up**
The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

For more information about validated VPN devices that are known to be compatible with VPN gateways, and whether they support route-based or policy-based VPN gateways, see [About VPN devices and IPSec/IKE parameters for site-to-site VPN Gateway connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices).
