Exercise - Create a site-to-site VPN gateway by using Azure CLI commands

25 minutes

Sandbox activated! Time remaining:  

1 hr 45 min

You have used 3 of 10 sandboxes for today. More sandboxes will be available tomorrow.

You're now ready to complete your site-to-site VPN gateway by creating the public IP addresses, virtual network gateways, and connections. Remember that you used placeholders for the public IP address references when you created your local network gateways. So one of your tasks now is to update these gateways with the actual public IP addresses assigned to your virtual network gateways.

Ideally, the public IP addresses and virtual network gateways should be created before the local network gateways. In this exercise, you'll see how to update the local network gateways. You can use the same commands to update any configuration elements in the local network gateways, like remote network address spaces.


**Create the Azure-side VPN gateway**

First, you'll create the VPN gateway for the Azure end of the connection. It can take up to 45 minutes to create a virtual network gateway. To save time, you'll use Azure CLI commands with the --no-wait parameter. This parameter lets you create both virtual network gateways simultaneously to minimize the overall time required to create these resources.

1. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the PIP-VNG-Azure-VNet-1 public IP address.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network public-ip create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name PIP-VNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --allocation-method Dynamic

2. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the VNG-Azure-VNet-1 virtual network.
        
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name VNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --subnet-name GatewaySubnet 

3. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the VNG-Azure-VNet-1 virtual network gateway.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet-gateway create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name VNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --public-ip-address PIP-VNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --vnet VNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --gateway-type Vpn \
            --vpn-type RouteBased \
            --sku VpnGw1 \
            --no-wait

4. Create the on-premises VPN gateway

Next, you'll create a VPN gateway to simulate an on-premises VPN device.

1. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the PIP-VNG-HQ-Network public IP address.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network public-ip create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name PIP-VNG-HQ-Network \
            --allocation-method Dynamic

2. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the VNG-HQ-Network virtual network.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name VNG-HQ-Network \
            --subnet-name GatewaySubnet 

3. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create the VNG-HQ-Network virtual network gateway.
        
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet-gateway create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name VNG-HQ-Network \
            --public-ip-address PIP-VNG-HQ-Network \
            --vnet HQ-Network \
            --gateway-type Vpn \
            --vpn-type RouteBased \
            --sku VpnGw1 \
            --no-wait

4. Gateway creation will take several minutes to complete. To monitor the progress of the gateway creation, run the following command. We're using the Linux watch command to run the az network vnet-gateway list command periodically, which enables you to monitor the progress.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        watch -d -n 5 az network vnet-gateway list \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --output table

After each VPN gateway shows a ProvisioningState of Succeeded, you're ready to continue. Press Ctrl+C to halt the command after the gateway is created.

    Output

    Copy
    ActiveActive    EnableBgp    EnablePrivateIpAddress   GatewayType    Location        Name              ProvisioningState    ResourceGroup                         ResourceGuid                          VpnType

**Update the local network gateway IP references**

    Important
    Your virtual network gateways must be successfully deployed before you start the next exercise.

In this section, you'll update the remote gateway IP address references that are defined in the local network gateways. You can't update the local network gateways until you've created the VPN gateways and an IPv4 address is assigned to and associated with them. Use the following Azure CLI command to check whether both virtual network gateways have been created.

    Azure CLI

    Copy
    az network vnet-gateway list \
        --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
        --query "[?provisioningState=='Succeeded']" \
        --output table


    Output

    Copy
    Name              Location    GatewayType    VpnType     VpnGatewayGeneration    EnableBgp    EnablePrivateIpAddress    Active    ResourceGuid                        ProvisioningState    ResourceGroup

    VNG-HQ-Network    westus      Vpn            RouteBased  Generation1         False        False                     False     c36430ed-e6c0-4230-ae40-cf937a102bcd  Succeeded            learn-cfbcca66-16fd-423e-b688-66f242d8f09e

Remember to wait until the lists of gateways are successfully returned. Also, remember that the local network gateway resources define the settings of the remote gateway and network that they're named after. For example, the LNG-Azure-VNet-1 local network gateway contains information like the IP address and networks for Azure-VNet-1.

1. Run this command in Cloud Shell to retrieve the IPv4 address assigned to PIP-VNG-Azure-VNet-1 and store it in a variable.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        PIPVNGAZUREVNET1=$(az network public-ip show \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name PIP-VNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --query "[ipAddress]" \
            --output tsv)

2. Run this command in Cloud Shell to update the LNG-Azure-VNet-1 local network gateway so that it points to the public IP address attached to the VNG-Azure-VNet-1 virtual network gateway.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network local-gateway update \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name LNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --gateway-ip-address $PIPVNGAZUREVNET1

3. Run this command in Cloud Shell to retrieve the IPv4 address assigned to PIP-VNG-HQ-Network and store it in a variable.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        PIPVNGHQNETWORK=$(az network public-ip show \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name PIP-VNG-HQ-Network \
            --query "[ipAddress]" \
            --output tsv)
4. Run this command in Cloud Shell to update the LNG-HQ-Network local network gateway so that it points to the public IP address attached to the VNG-HQ-Network virtual network gateway.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network local-gateway update \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name LNG-HQ-Network \
            --gateway-ip-address $PIPVNGHQNETWORK

**Create the connections**
You'll now complete the configuration by creating the connections from each VPN gateway to the local network gateway that contains the public IP address references for that gateway's remote network.

1. Create the shared key to use for the connections. In the following command, replace <shared key> with a text string to use for the IPSec pre-shared key. The pre-shared key is a string of printable ASCII characters no longer than 128 characters. You'll use this pre-shared key on both connections.
 
     Note
    Any set of number will work for a shared key in this example: SHAREDKEY=123456789 It is recommended in production environments to use string of printable ASCII characters no longer than 128 characters.


    Bash

    Copy
      SHAREDKEY=<shared key>

1. Remember that LNG-HQ-Network contains a reference to the IP address on your simulated on-premises VPN device. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create a connection from VNG-Azure-VNet-1 to LNG-HQ-Network.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vpn-connection create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name Azure-VNet-1-To-HQ-Network \
            --vnet-gateway1 VNG-Azure-VNet-1 \
            --shared-key $SHAREDKEY \
            --local-gateway2 LNG-HQ-Network

2. Remember that LNG-Azure-VNet-1 contains a reference to the public IP address associated with the VNG-Azure-VNet-1 VPN gateway. This connection would normally be created from your on-premises device. Run this command in Cloud Shell to create a connection from VNG-HQ-Network to LNG-Azure-VNet-1.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vpn-connection create \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name HQ-Network-To-Azure-VNet-1  \
            --vnet-gateway1 VNG-HQ-Network \
            --shared-key $SHAREDKEY \
            --local-gateway2 LNG-Azure-VNet-1

You've now finished the configuration of the site-to-site connection. This may take a few minutes, but the tunnels should automatically connect and become active.


**Verification steps**

Let's confirm that the VPN tunnels are connected.

1. Run the following command to confirm that Azure-VNet-1-To-HQ-Network is connected.
        
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vpn-connection show \
            --resource-group learn-926ca5be-7e55-4a32-aa3c-18875407a064 \
            --name Azure-VNet-1-To-HQ-Network  \
            --output table \
            --query '{Name:name,ConnectionStatus:connectionStatus}'

You should see output like below indicating the connection is successful. If the ConnectionStatus shows as Connecting or Unknown, wait a minute or two and rerun the command. The connections can take a few minutes to fully connect.

    Output

    Copy
    Name                        ConnectionStatus
    --------------------------  ------------------
    Azure-VNet-1-To-HQ-Network  Connected

The site-to-site configuration is now complete. Your final topology, including the subnets, and connections, with logical connection points, is shown in this diagram. Virtual machines deployed in the Services and Applications subnets can now communicate with each other, now that the VPN connections have been successfully established.
