**Exercise - Set up your environment**

40 minutes

In this exercise, you'll set up a preconfigured environment with a load balancer and create charts to monitor the health of the load balancer.

This exercise is optional. To complete it, you need access to an Azure subscription where you can create Azure resources. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.


**Set up your environment**

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Select Cloud Shell from the menu bar in the upper right.
3. Select Bash.
4. Run the following command to download the scripts you'll use for this exercise.

        Bash

        Copy
        git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-troubleshoot-inbound-network-connectivity-azure-load-balancer load-balancer
5. Go to the load-balancer/src/scripts folder.

        Bash

        Copy
        cd ~/load-balancer/src/scripts
6. Run the following command to set the user name for the VMs. You can change the user name to something different. You'll need the user name later in this exercise, so make a note of what you use.

        Bash

        Copy
        export USERNAME=azureuser
7. Run the following command to create a password for the virtual machines created by the scripts. The password is stored in a variable and also recorded in the text file passwd.txt in case you need it later.

        Bash

        Copy
        export PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
        echo $PASSWORD > passwd.txt
8. Set the resource group name.

        Bash

        Copy
        export RESOURCEGROUP=learn-ts-loadbalancer-rg
9. Set the location. Replace the eastus value with a location near you.

        Bash

        Copy
        export LOCATION=eastus
        The following list has some location values you can use:
        westus2
        southcentralus
        centralus
        eastus
        westeurope
        southeastasia
        japaneast
        brazilsouth
        australiasoutheast
        centralindia
10. Run the following command to create a resource group.

        Bash

        Copy
        az group create --name $RESOURCEGROUP --location $LOCATION

11. Run the following command to create the load balancer, virtual machines, and virtual network.
        Bash

        Copy
        bash setup.sh $RESOURCEGROUP
12. This script takes up to 25 minutes to run.


**Check resources created**

1. In the Azure portal, search for Resource groups.
2. Select learn-ts-loadbalancer-rg.
3. Sort the list of resources by Type.
4. The resource group should contain the resources shown in this table.
Name    | Type   |  Description
------------- | -------------| -------------
retailappvm1_disk1_xxx and retailappvm1_disk1_xxx    | Disk   |  Virtual hard disks for the two VMs.
retailapplb   |  Load balancer   |  Load balancer for the app running on the VMs. The back-end pool in the load balancer references the retailappvm1 and retailappvm2 virtual machines.
nicvm1 and nicvm2  |   Network interface  |   Network interfaces for the two VMs.
retailappnicvm1nsg, and retailappnicvm2nsg   |  Network security group (NSG)   |  NSGs that control the traffic entering each VM.
retailappnsg   |  Network security group   |  Acts as an initial filter for both virtual machines, but the NSG for each virtual machine provides the ability to filter traffic on a per-machine basis.
retailappip |    Public IP address |    Public IP address that provides front-end access to the load balancer.
retailappvm1 and retailappvm2    Virtual machine    VMs running the retail application.
retailappvmjumpbox  |   Virtual machine  |   VM that is also in the virtual network but has a public IP address. An administrator can sign in to this virtual machine to access the retailappvm1 and retailappvm2 VMs, which only have private IP addresses.
retailappvnet   |  Virtual network  |   Virtual network for the VMs.


5. Select the retailapplb load balancer.
6. Under Settings, select Load balancing rules.
7. Select retailapprule. The load balancer is configured to route traffic that arrives on port 80 at the front-end address to port 80 on machines in the back-end pool.
8. Close the retailapprule page.
9. Under Settings, select Health probes.
10. Select retailapphealthprobe. The health probe for the back-end pool also sends messages to port 80 to check that the application is available on each virtual machine.
11. Close the retailapphealthprobe page.



**Test the load balancer**
1. Return to Azure Cloud Shell.
2. Run the following command to find the public IP address of the load balancer front end.
   
       Bash

        Copy
        bash findip.sh
3. Open a browser window, and go to this IP address. The result should be a page with the message retailappvm1 or retailappvm2, depending on how Load Balancer has routed the request.

4. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to go to the src/stresstest folder.

        Bash

        Copy
        cd ~/load-balancer/src/stresstest

This folder contains a .NET Core application that simulates hundreds of concurrent users sending requests through Load Balancer to the virtual machines.

5. Run the following command to start the application. Replace <ip address> with the front-end IP address of the load balancer.

        Bash

        Copy
        dotnet run <ip address>

The application should respond with a series of messages that indicate whether a response was received from retailappvm1 or retailappvm2.

6. Allow the application to run for five minutes. Select Enter to stop the application.



**Create charts to monitor metrics**
1. In the Azure portal, go to the resource group learn-ts-loadbalancer-rg.
2. Select the retailapplb load balancer.
3. Under Monitoring, select Metrics.
4. Add the following metric to the empty chart:
Property   |  Value
------------- | -------------
Scope   |  retailapplb
Metric Namespace   |  Load balancer standard metrics
Metric  |   Packet Count
Aggregation  |   Avg

5. Select the Finish editing check box.
6. At the top of the page, set the time range to Last 30 minutes. The chart should look similar to the one shown here. Note the peak value of the average packet count.

The average packet count while the load balancer is in a healthy state.

7. Select Pin to dashboard.
8. Select Create new, and use the following values:
Field   |   Value
------------- | -------------
Type   |   Private
Dashboard name   |   dashboard-learn-ts-loadbalancer


10. Select Create and pin.
Select + New Chart, and add the following metric:
Property  |    Value
------------- | -------------
Scope    |  retailapplb
Metric Namespace   |   Load balancer standard metrics
Metric   |   Health Probe Status
Aggregation    |  Avg


11. Select Add metric, and add another metric to the chart with the following settings:
Property    |  Value
------------- | -------------
Scope  |    retailapplb
Metric Namespace   |   Load balancer standard metrics
Metric    |  Data Path Availability
Aggregation    |  Avg

12. Select the Finish editing check box.
12. Set the time range to Last 30 minutes. The chart should report both statistics at 100 percent.
14. Select Pin to dashboard > Existing.
15. For a dashboard, select dashboard-learn-ts-loadbalancer.
16. Select Pin.

You now have a baseline set of metrics for the system when it's running correctly.
