**Introduction**

2 minutes

With Azure Load Balancer, you can distribute incoming network traffic across a group of back-end resources or services such as virtual machines (VMs). Load Balancer helps you scale your applications while maintaining throughput and keeping response times low.

Imagine you're an administrator for a large retail company that uses Load Balancer to distribute inbound internet traffic to your virtual machines. You've configured an alert in Azure Monitor to notify you when a virtual machine fails a load balancer health check. Recently, another administrator made some changes to the virtual network configuration. Several alerts tell you that the health checks for all virtual machines behind the load balancer are failing.


**Learning objectives**

In this module, you will:
* Identify common load balancer inbound connectivity issues.
* Identify steps to resolve issues when virtual machines aren't responding to a health probe.


**Prerequisites**
* Basic understanding of Azure Load Balancer
* Familiarity with Azure Virtual Machines
* Basic understanding of Azure Monitor
* (Optional) Access to an Azure subscription
