**Summary**

2 minutes

In this module, you learned how to use peering to connect virtual networks in a hub and spoke topology. You used VMs and SSH to verify connectivity between virtual networks. The peering connections will enable communication for services that run on the VMs.

Now that you understand how to peer virtual networks together, you can use this cost-effective and minimally complex method in your Azure network infrastructure. The method enables low-latency communication between resources in virtual networks. It supports scenarios where resources are in different regions or subscriptions. Virtual network peering should be your first choice when you need to connect virtual networks.

**Clean up**

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.
When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
