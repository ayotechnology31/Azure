This module requires a sandbox to complete. A sandbox gives you access to free resources. Your personal subscription will not be charged. The sandbox may only be used to complete training on Microsoft Learn. Use for any other reason is prohibited, and may result in permanent loss of access to the sandbox.

In the previous unit, you configured peering connections between the virtual networks to enable resources to communicate with each other. Your configuration used a hub and spoke topology. MarketingVNet was the hub, and SalesVNet and ResearchVNet were spokes.

Remember, peering connections are nontransitive. Intermediate virtual networks don't allow connectivity to flow through them to connected virtual networks. SalesVNet can communicate with MarketingVNet. ResearchVNet can communicate with MarketingVNet. MarketingVNet can communicate with both SalesVNet and ResearchVNet. The only communication that's not permitted is between SalesVNet and ResearchVNet. Even though SalesVNet and ResearchVNet are both connected to MarketingVNet, they can't communicate with each other because they're not directly peered to each other.

Let's confirm the connectivity across the peering connections. To do this, you'll first create a connection from Azure Cloud Shell to a target VM's public IP address. Then you'll connect from the target VM to the destination VM by using the destination VM's private IP address.
 
     Important
    To test the virtual network peering connection, connect to the private IP address assigned to each VM.

1. To connect to your VMs, you'll use SSH (Secure Shell) directly from Cloud Shell. When using SSH, you first find the public IP addresses that are assigned to your test VMs.

2. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to list the IP addresses you'll use to connect to the VMs.
Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm list \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --query "[*].{Name:name, PrivateIP:privateIps, PublicIP:publicIps}" \
            --show-details \
            --output table
            
3. Record the output. You'll need the IP addresses for the exercises in this unit.

Before you start the tests, think about what you've learned in this module. What results do you expect? Which VMs will and will not be able to communicate with each other?


**Test connections from SalesVM**

In the first test, in Cloud Shell you'll use SSH to connect to the public IP address of SalesVM. You'll then attempt to connect from SalesVM to MarketingVM and ResearchVM.
1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the public IP address of SalesVM. In the command, replace <SalesVM public IP> with the VM's public IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<SalesVM public IP>

Connect to the public IP address of SalesVM

2. Sign in with the password that you used to create the VM. The prompt now shows that you're signed in to SalesVM.
3. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of MarketingVM. In the command, replace <MarketingVM private IP> with this VM's private IP address.

Bash

    Copy
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<MarketingVM private IP>

Connect from SalesVM to the private IP address of MarketingVM

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/integrate-vnets-with-vnet-peering/media/5-sales-step-5.svg)

The connection attempt should succeed because of the peering connection between the SalesVNet and MarketingVNet virtual networks.

4. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

5. Enter exit to close this SSH session and return to the SalesVM prompt.

6. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of ResearchVM. In the command, replace <ResearchVM private IP> with this VM's private IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<ResearchVM private IP>
        
7. The connection attempt should fail because there's no peering connection between the SalesVNet and ResearchVNet virtual networks. Up to 60 seconds might pass before the connection attempt times out. To force the attempt to stop, use Ctrl+C.

8. Enter exit to close the SSH session and return to Cloud Shell.


**Test connections from ResearchVM**

In the second test, in Cloud Shell you'll use SSH to connect to the public IP address of ResearchVM. You'll then attempt to connect from ResearchVM to MarketingVM and SalesVM.
1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the public IP address of ResearchVM. In the command, replace <ResearchVM public IP> with this VM's public IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<ResearchVM public IP>

Connect to the public IP address of ResearchVM

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/integrate-vnets-with-vnet-peering/media/5-research-step-1.svg)

2. Sign in by using the password that you used to create the VM. The prompt now shows that you're signed in to ResearchVM.

3. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of MarketingVM. In the command, replace <MarketingVM private IP> with this VM's private IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<MarketingVM private IP>
Connect to the private IP address of MarketingVM
![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/integrate-vnets-with-vnet-peering/media/5-research-step-5.svg)

The connection attempt should succeed because of the peering connection between the ResearchVNet and MarketingVNet virtual networks.

4. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

5. Enter exit to close this SSH session and return to the ResearchVM prompt.
6. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of SalesVM. In the command, replace <SalesVM private IP> with this VM's private IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<SalesVM private IP>

7. The connection attempt should fail because there's no peering connection between the ResearchVNet and SalesVNet virtual networks. Up to 60 seconds might pass before the connection attempt times out. To force the attempt to stop, use Ctrl+C.

8. Enter exit to close the SSH session and return to Cloud Shell.


**Test connections from Marketing VM**

In the final test, in Cloud Shell you'll use SSH to connect to the public IP address of MarketingVM. You'll then attempt to connect from MarketingVM to ResearchVM and SalesVM.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the public IP address of MarketingVM. In the command, replace <MarketingVM public IP> with this VM's public IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<MarketingVM public IP>

Connect to the public IP address of MarketingVM

2. Sign in by using the password that you used to create the VM. The prompt shows that you're signed in to MarketingVM.

3. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of ResearchVM. In the command, replace <ResearchVM private IP> with this VM's private IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<ResearchVM private IP>
        

The connection attempt should succeed because of the peering connection between the MarketingVNet and ResearchVNet virtual networks.

4. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

5. Enter exit to close this SSH session, and return to the MarketingVM prompt.

6. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of SalesVM. In the command, replace <SalesVM private IP> with this VM's private IP address.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<SalesVM private IP>

The connection attempt should also succeed because there is a peering connection between the MarketingVNet and SalesVNet virtual networks.

7. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

8. Enter exit to close this SSH session, and return to the MarketingVM prompt.

9. Enter exit to close the SSH session, and return to Cloud Shell.

This is a simple test using SSH. It demonstrates network connectivity between peered virtual networks. It also demonstrates lack of network connectivity for transitive connections.

If these servers were running application services, the server connectivity would allow communication between the services running on the VMs. The connectivity would allow the business to share data across departments as required.
