Now you have created virtual networks and have run virtual machines (VMs) within them. But the virtual networks have no connectivity, and none of these systems can communicate with each other.

To enable communication, you need to create peering connections for the virtual networks. To satisfy your company's requirements, configure a hub and spoke topology, and permit virtual network access when you create the peering connections.


**Create virtual network peering connections**
Follow these steps to create connections between the virtual networks and to configure the behavior of each connection.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create the peering connection between the SalesVNet and MarketingVNet virtual networks. This command also permits virtual network access across this peering connection.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet peering create \
            --name SalesVNet-To-MarketingVNet \
            --remote-vnet MarketingVNet \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --vnet-name SalesVNet \
            --allow-vnet-access

2. Run the following command to create a reciprocal connection from MarketingVNet to SalesVNet. This step completes the connection between these virtual networks.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet peering create \
            --name MarketingVNet-To-SalesVNet \
            --remote-vnet SalesVNet \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --vnet-name MarketingVNet \
            --allow-vnet-access

Now that you have connections between Sales and Marketing, create connections between Marketing and Research.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create the peering connection between the MarketingVNet and ResearchVNet virtual networks.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet peering create \
            --name MarketingVNet-To-ResearchVNet \
            --remote-vnet ResearchVNet \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --vnet-name MarketingVNet \
            --allow-vnet-access

2. Run the following command to create the reciprocal connection between ResearchVNet and MarketingVNet.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet peering create \
            --name ResearchVNet-To-MarketingVNet \
            --remote-vnet MarketingVNet \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --vnet-name ResearchVNet \
            --allow-vnet-access


**Check the virtual network peering connections**

Now that you've created the peering connections between the virtual networks, make sure the connections work.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to check the connection between SalesVNet and MarketingVNet.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet peering list \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --vnet-name SalesVNet \
            --output table

2. You've created only one connection from SalesVNet, so you see only one result. In the PeeringState column, make sure the status is Connected.

3. Run the following command to check the peering connection between the ResearchVNet and MarketingVNet virtual networks.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet peering list \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --vnet-name ResearchVNet \
            --output table

4. Again, you've created only one connection from ResearchVNet, so you see only one result. In the PeeringState column, make sure the status is Connected.

5. Run the following command to check the peering connections for the MarketingVNet virtual network.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network vnet peering list \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --vnet-name MarketingVNet \
            --output table

Remember that you created connections from Marketing to Sales and from Marketing to Research, so you should see two connections. In the PeeringState column, make sure the status of both connections is Connected.

Your peering connections between the virtual networks should now look like this:

**Check effective routes**

You can further check the peering connection by looking at the routes that apply to the network interfaces of the VMs.

1. Run the following command to look at the routes that apply to the SalesVM network interface.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nic show-effective-route-table \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --name SalesVMVMNic \
            --output table

The output table shows the effective routes for the VM's network interface. For SalesVMVMNic, you should see a route to 10.2.0.0/16 with a next hop type of VNetPeering. This is the network route for the peering connection from SalesVNet to MarketingVNet.

        Output

        Copy
        Source    State    Address Prefix    Next Hop Type    Next Hop IP
        --------  -------  ----------------  ---------------  -------------
        Default   Active   10.1.0.0/16       VnetLocal
        Default   Active   10.2.0.0/16       VNetPeering
        Default   Active   0.0.0.0/0         Internet
        Default   Active   10.0.0.0/8        None
        Default   Active   100.64.0.0/10     None
        Default   Active   192.168.0.0/16    None
2. Look at the routes for MarketingVM.
        
        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nic show-effective-route-table \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --name MarketingVMVMNic \
            --output table

The output table shows the effective routes for the VM's network interface. For MarketingVMVMNic, you should see a route to 10.1.0.0/16 and 10.3.0.0/16 with a next hop type of VNetGlobalPeering. These are the network routes for the peering connection from MarketingVNet to SalesVNet and from MarketingVNet to ResearchVNet.

    Output

    Copy
    Source    State    Address Prefix    Next Hop Type      Next Hop IP
    --------  -------  ----------------  -----------------  -------------
    Default   Active   10.2.0.0/16       VnetLocal
    Default   Active   10.1.0.0/16       VNetPeering
    Default   Active   0.0.0.0/0         Internet
    Default   Active   10.0.0.0/8        None
    Default   Active   100.64.0.0/10     None
    Default   Active   192.168.0.0/16    None
    Default   Active   10.3.0.0/16       VNetGlobalPeering

3. Look at the routes for ResearchVM.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az network nic show-effective-route-table \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --name ResearchVMVMNic \
            --output table

The output table shows the effective routes for the VM's network interface. For ResearchVMVMNic, you should see a route to 10.2.0.0/16 with a next hop type of VNetGlobalPeering. This is the network route for the peering connection from ResearchVNet to MarketingVNet.

    Output

    Copy
    Source    State    Address Prefix    Next Hop Type      Next Hop IP
    --------  -------  ----------------  -----------------  -------------
    Default   Active   10.3.0.0/16       VnetLocal
    Default   Active   0.0.0.0/0         Internet
    Default   Active   10.0.0.0/8        None
    Default   Active   100.64.0.0/10     None
    Default   Active   192.168.0.0/16    None
    Default   Active   10.2.0.0/16       VNetGlobalPeering


Now that your peering connections are configured, let's take a look at how this affects the communication between VMs.
