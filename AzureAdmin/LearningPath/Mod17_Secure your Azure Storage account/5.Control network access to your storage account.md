**Control network access to your storage account**

5 minutes

By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to selected networks, you must first change the default action. You can restrict access to specific IP addresses, ranges, or virtual networks.

    Important
    Changing network rules can affect your application's ability to connect to Azure Storage. If you set the default network rule to deny, you'll block all access to the data unless specific network rules grant access. Before you change the default rule to deny access, be sure to use network rules to grant access to any allowed networks.

**Manage default network access rules**

Manage default network access rules for storage accounts through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.

Follow these steps to change default network access in the Azure portal.

1. Go to the storage account you want to secure.

2. Select Networking.

3. To restrict traffic from selected networks, select Selected networks. To allow traffic from all networks, select All networks.

4. To apply your changes, select Save.
