Understand Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Storage

5 minutes

Azure Defender for Storage provides an extra layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without being a security expert or managing security monitoring systems.

Security alerts are triggered when anomalies in activity occur. These security alerts are integrated with Azure Security Center, and are also sent via email to subscription administrators, with details of suspicious activity and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.

Azure Defender for Storage is currently available for Blob storage, Azure Files, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Account types that support Azure Defender include general-purpose v2, block blob, and Blob storage accounts. Azure Defender for 
Storage is available in all public clouds and US government clouds, but not in other sovereign or Azure Government cloud regions.

Accounts with hierarchical namespaces enabled for Data Lake Storage support transactions using both the Azure Blob storage APIs and the Data Lake Storage APIs. Azure file shares support transactions over SMB.

You can turn on Azure Defender for Storage in the Azure portal through the configuration page of the Azure Storage account, or in the advanced security section of the Azure portal. Follow these steps.

1. Launch the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to your storage account. Under Settings, select Advanced security.
3. Select Enable Azure Defender for Storage.
