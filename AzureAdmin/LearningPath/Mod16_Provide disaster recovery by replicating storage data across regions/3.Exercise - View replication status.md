Exercise - View replication status

7 minutes

In this unit, you'll create a storage account and configure a blob container for it. You'll create a blob file and upload it to your storage account. You can then view the replication status in the Azure portal.

Important
You need your own Azure subscription to run this exercise, and you might incur charges. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.


Create a storage account

Create a storage account with geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS).
1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. From the menu bar in the upper right, open Cloud Shell.
3. Set the resource group name.

        Bash

        Copy
        export RESOURCEGROUP=learn-storage-replication-rg

4. To set the storage account name where you replace storageaccountname and the brackets with a unique Azure Storage account name, run this command.

        Bash

        Copy
        export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<storageaccountname>
5. Set the location. Replace the westus2 value with a location near you.

        Bash

        Copy
        export LOCATION=westus2

The following list has some location values you can use:
* southeastasia
* northeurope
* westeurope
* japaneast
* uksouth
* centralus
* eastus2
* westus2

6. To create a resource group, run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az group create --name $RESOURCEGROUP --location $LOCATION

7. To create a storage account, run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az storage account create \
        --name $AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT \
        --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
        --location $LOCATION \
        --sku Standard_GZRS \
        --encryption-services blob \
        --kind StorageV2

8. For the rest of the steps in this exercise, you'll need your storage credentials. To list your storage account keys, run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az storage account keys list \
        --account-name $AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT \
        --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
        --output table

9. Copy the keys listed.
10. To hold your storage key, set an environment variable. Replace account-key and the brackets with one of your key values.

        Bash

        Copy
        export AZURE_STORAGE_KEY="<account-key>"


**Create a blob container**
To upload blobs to Azure Storage, you need a container. You use containers to logically group your blobs. A container helps you organize blobs, like a folder organizes files on your computer.

1. To set a container name where you replace blob-container-name and the brackets with another name, run this command.

        Bash

        Copy
        export BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME=<blob-container-name>

2. Run the following command to create a container for your storage account:

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az storage container create --account-key $AZURE_STORAGE_KEY --account-name $AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT --name $BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME

3. When your storage account container has been created, you'll see this message returned in your terminal.

        Output

        Copy
        {
            "created": true
        }


**Create a file (blob)**

Your company uploads its music files as blobs in the container. A blob can represent a file of any type. For the purposes of this exercise, you'll upload a text file as a blob.

1. To create a file you can upload to your storage account, run this command.

        Bash

        Copy
        cat > song.mp3

2. An empty file is created that you can write to. Enter This is a song!, select Enter, and then select Ctrl+D.

3. To see the contents of your song.mp3 file, run this command.

        Bash

        Copy
        cat song.mp3


4. You'll see This is a song! returned to you in the terminal. You've created a file you can now upload to your storage account.


**Upload your file**

Upload the file to your storage account via your container.

1. To upload your file, run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az storage blob upload \
            --container-name $BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME \
            --name song \
            --file song.mp3

2. When the upload is complete, to verify the file is in your storage account, run this command.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az storage blob list \
        --container-name $BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME  \
        --output table

3. You'll see details about your file, like its name, blob type, and when it was last modified.

**View the replication status**

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. Select or search for Resource groups.

3. Select learn-storage-replication-rg.

4. Select the storage account you created from the list of resources in your resource group.

5. Under Settings, select Geo-replication. You see the replication status of your Azure Storage account's primary and secondary regions. If the status shows as available for a region, it means your region is responsive.

6. To ensure you're seeing the latest status updates, select Refresh.

![Screenshot of the geo-replication map that shows the primary and secondary locations available.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/provide-disaster-recovery-replicate-storage-data/media/3-view-replication-status.png)

It will take some time for your data to replicate from the primary to the secondary region.
