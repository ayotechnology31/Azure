**Summary**

2 minutes

Your CRM application is a complex system that stores data in Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Data Lake. You wanted an easy-to-use tool that helps your engineers to administer the data in the different Azure locations.

You can use Azure Storage Explorer to give your developers a tool that manages and controls data stored in Azure, including Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Data Lake Gen1 and Gen2.

You can explore your Azure data with many different tools, depending on its location and your preference. For example, the Azure portal includes a web-based interface that presents the contents of a storage account. Or you can use the Azure CLI at the command line.

In this module, you've explored different ways to use Storage Explorer to connect to your storage accounts. You've used the Azure CLI to create Cosmos DB and Data Lake Gen2 storage accounts. Finally, you've connected Storage Explorer to a Cosmos DB database and a data lake. Then you uploaded and viewed the data that's stored there.
