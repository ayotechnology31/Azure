Summary

1 minute

In this module, you learned how to customize routes in an Azure virtual network and how to redirect the traffic flow through a network virtual appliance. You also learned how to create your own custom network virtual appliance by deploying an Azure virtual machine.

Clean up

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
