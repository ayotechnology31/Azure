**Exercise - Create custom routes**

As you implement your security strategy, you want to control how network traffic is routed across your Azure infrastructure.
In the following exercise, you'll use a network virtual appliance (NVA) to help secure and monitor traffic. You'll want to ensure communication between front-end public servers and internal private servers is always routed through the appliance.

You'll configure the network so that all traffic flowing from a public subnet to a private subnet will be routed through the NVA. To make this flow happen, you'll create a custom route for the public subnet to route this traffic to a perimeter-network subnet. Later, you'll deploy an NVA to the perimeter-network subnet.

In this exercise, you'll create the route table, custom route, and subnets. You'll then associate the route table with a subnet.


**Create a route table and custom route**

The first task is to create a new routing table and then add a custom route for all traffic intended for the private subnet.

1. In Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a route table.

        az network route-table create \
                --name publictable \
                --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
                --disable-bgp-route-propagation false
2. Run the following command in Cloud Shell to create a custom route.

        az network route-table route create \
                --route-table-name publictable \
                --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
                --name productionsubnet \
                --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 \
                --next-hop-type VirtualAppliance \
                --next-hop-ip-address 10.0.2.4


**Create a virtual network and subnets**
T
he next task is to create the **vnet **virtual network and the three subnets that you need: **publicsubnet, privatesubnet, and dmzsubnet.**

1. Run the following command to create the **vnet** virtual network and the **publicsubnet** subnet.


        az network vnet create \
                --name vnet \
                --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
                --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
                --subnet-name publicsubnet \
                --subnet-prefix 10.0.0.0/24
2. Run the following command in Cloud Shell to create the **privatesubnet** subnet.

        az network vnet subnet create \
                --name privatesubnet \
                --vnet-name vnet \
                --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
                --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24

3. Run the following command to create the dmzsubnet subnet.

        az network vnet subnet create \
                --name dmzsubnet \
                --vnet-name vnet \
                --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
                --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24
        

4. You should now have three subnets. Run the following command to show all of the subnets in the vnet virtual network.

        az network vnet subnet list \
                --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
                --vnet-name vnet \
                --output table
        

**Associate the route table with the public subnet**

The final task in this exercise is to associate the route table with the **publicsubnet** subnet.

Run the following command to associate the route table with the public subnet.

    az network vnet subnet update \
            --name publicsubnet \
            --vnet-name vnet \
            --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
            --route-table publictable
