**Introduction**

2 minutes

A virtual network lets you implement a security perimeter around your resources in the cloud. You can control the information that flows in and out of a virtual network. You can also restrict access to only the traffic that originates from trusted sources.

Suppose you're the solution architect for a retail organization. Also suppose your organization recently suffered a security incident that exposed customer information such as names, addresses, and credit cards. Malicious actors infiltrated vulnerabilities in the retailer's network infrastructure, which resulted in the loss of customers' confidential information.

As part of a remediation plan, the security team recommends adding network protections in the form of network virtual appliances. The cloud infrastructure team must ensure traffic is properly routed through the virtual appliances and is inspected for malicious activity.

You'll learn about Azure routing and you'll create custom routes to control the traffic flow. You'll also learn to redirect the traffic through the network virtual appliance so you can inspect the traffic before it's allowed through.

Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:
* Identify the routing capabilities of an Azure virtual network.
* Configure routing within a virtual network.
* Deploy a basic network virtual appliance.
* Configure routing to send traffic through a network virtual appliance.


**Prerequisites**
* Knowledge of basic networking concepts, including subnets and IP addressing
* Familiarity with Azure virtual networking
