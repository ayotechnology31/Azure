**Exercise - Route traffic through the NVA**

10 minutes

Sandbox activated! Time remaining:  
1 hr 16 min

You have used 2 of 10 sandboxes for today. More sandboxes will be available tomorrow.

Now that you've created the network virtual appliance (NVA) and virtual machines, you'll route the traffic through the NVA.

Virtual machines and IP addresses

**Create public and private virtual machines**
The next steps deploy a virtual machine into the public and private subnets:

1. Open the Cloud Shell editor and create a file named cloud-init.txt.
    
        Bash

        Copy
        code cloud-init.txt

2. Add the following configuration information to the file. With this configuration, the inetutils-traceroute package is installed when you create a new virtual machine. This package contains the traceroute utility that you'll use later in this exercise.

        Text

        Copy
        #cloud-config
        package_upgrade: true
        packages:
           - inetutils-traceroute

3. Select Ctrl+S to save the file, and then select Ctrl+Q to close the editor.

4. Run the following command in Cloud Shell to create the public virtual machine. Replace <password> with a suitable password for the azureuser account.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm create \
            --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
            --name public \
            --vnet-name vnet \
            --subnet publicsubnet \
            --image UbuntuLTS \
            --admin-username azureuser \
            --no-wait \
            --custom-data cloud-init.txt \
            --admin-password <password>

5. Run the following command to create the private virtual machine. Replace <password> with a suitable password.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        az vm create \
            --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
            --name private \
            --vnet-name vnet \
            --subnet privatesubnet \
            --image UbuntuLTS \
            --admin-username azureuser \
            --no-wait \
            --custom-data cloud-init.txt \
            --admin-password <password>
6. Run the following Linux watch command to check that the virtual machines are running. The watch command periodically runs the az vm list command so that you can monitor the progress of the virtual machines.

        Bash

        Copy
        watch -d -n 5 "az vm list \
            --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
            --show-details \
            --query '[*].{Name:name, ProvisioningState:provisioningState, PowerState:powerState}' \
            --output table"

A **ProvisioningState** value of "Succeeded" and a PowerState value of "VM running" indicate a successful deployment. When all three virtual machines are running, you're ready to move on. Select Ctrl-C to stop the command and continue with the exercise.

7. Run the following command to save the public IP address of the public virtual machine to a variable named PUBLICIP.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        PUBLICIP="$(az vm list-ip-addresses \
            --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
            --name public \
            --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress" \
            --output tsv)"

        echo $PUBLICIP

8. Run the following command to save the public IP address of the private virtual machine to a variable named PRIVATEIP.

        Azure CLI

        Copy
        PRIVATEIP="$(az vm list-ip-addresses \
            --resource-group learn-b2763909-73ba-4a37-bb72-f7e535d353d8 \
            --name private \
            --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress" \
            --output tsv)"

        echo $PRIVATEIP

**Test traffic routing through the network virtual appliance**

The final steps use the Linux traceroute utility to show how traffic is routed. You'll use the ssh command to run traceroute on each virtual machine. The first test will show the route taken by ICMP packets sent from the **public** virtual machine to the **private** virtual machine. The second test will show the route taken by ICMP packets sent from the **private** virtual machine to the **public** virtual machine.

1. Run the following command to trace the route from **public** to **private**. When prompted, enter the password for the **azureuser** account that you specified earlier.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -t -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@$PUBLICIP 'traceroute private --type=icmp; exit'

If you receive the error message bash: traceroute: command not found, wait a minute and retry the command. The automated installation of traceroute can take a minute or two after virtual machine deployment. After the command succeeds, the output should look similar to the following example:

    Text

    Copy
    traceroute to private.kzffavtrkpeulburui2lgywxwg.gx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.1.4), 64 hops max
    1   10.0.2.4  0.710ms  0.410ms  0.536ms
    2   10.0.1.4  0.966ms  0.981ms  1.268ms
    Connection to 52.165.151.216 closed.

Notice that the first hop is to 10.0.2.4. This address is the private IP address of **nva**. The second hop is to 10.0.1.4, the address of **private**. In the first exercise, you added this route to the route table and linked the table to the **publicsubnet** subnet. So now all traffic from **public** to **private** is routed through the network virtual appliance.

Route from public to private

2. Run the following command to trace the route from private to public. When prompted, enter the password for the azureuser account.

        Bash

        Copy
        ssh -t -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@$PRIVATEIP 'traceroute public --type=icmp; exit'

You should see the traffic go directly to public (10.0.0.4) and not through the NVA, as shown in the following command output.
    
    Text

    Copy
    traceroute to public.kzffavtrkpeulburui2lgywxwg.gx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4), 64 hops max
    1   10.0.0.4  1.095ms  1.610ms  0.812ms
    Connection to 52.173.21.188 closed.

The private virtual machine is using default routes, and traffic is routed directly between the subnets.

Route from private to public

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/media/6-private-public-route.svg)

You've now configured routing between subnets to direct traffic from the public internet through the **dmzsubnet** subnet before it reaches the private subnet. In the **dmzsubnet** subnet, you added a virtual machine that acts as an NVA. You can configure this NVA to detect potentially malicious requests and block them before they reach their intended targets.
